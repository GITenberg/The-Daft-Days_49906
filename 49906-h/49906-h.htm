<h2><a name="page1"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1</span>CHAPTER
I.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> town&rsquo;s bell rang through
the dark of the winter morning with queer little jolts and
pauses, as if Wanton Wully Oliver, the ringer, had been jovial
the night before.&nbsp; A blithe New-Year-time bell; a droll,
daft, scatter-brained bell; it gave no horrid alarums, no solemn
reminders that commonly toll from steeples and make good-fellows
melancholy to think upon things undone, the brevity of days and
years, the parting of good company, but a cheery
ditty&mdash;&ldquo;boom, boom, ding-a-dong boom, boom ding, hic,
ding-dong,&rdquo; infecting whoever heard it with a kind of
foolish gaiety.&nbsp; The burgh town turned on its pillows, drew
up its feet from the bed-bottles, last night hot, now turned to
chilly stone, rubbed its eyes, and knew by that bell it was the
daftest of the daft days come.&nbsp; It cast a merry spell on the
community; it tickled them even in their cosy beds.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Wanton Wully&rsquo;s on the ran-dan!&rdquo; said the folk,
and rose quickly, and ran to pull aside screens and blinds to
look out in the dark on window-ledges cushioned deep in
snow.&nbsp; The children hugged themselves under the blankets,
and told each other in whispers it was not a porridge morning,
no, nor Sunday, but a breakfast of shortbread, ham and eggs; and
behold! a beautiful loud drum, careless as &rsquo;twere a
reveille of hot wild youths, <a name="page2"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 2</span>began to beat in a distant lane.&nbsp;
Behind the house of Dyce the lawyer, a cock that must have been
young and hearty crew like to burst; and at the stables of the
post-office the man who housed his horses after bringing the
morning mail through night and storm from a distant railway
station sang a song,&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;A damsel possessed of great beauty<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Stood near by her own father&rsquo;s gate:<br />
The gallant hussars were on duty;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To view them this maiden did wait.<br />
Their horses were capering and prancing,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Their accoutrements shone like a star;<br />
From the plains they were quickly advancing,&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; She espied her own gallant hussar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mercy on us! six o&rsquo;clock!&rdquo; cried Miss Dyce,
with a startled jump from her dreams to the floor of her
bedroom.&nbsp; &ldquo;Six o&rsquo;clock on the New Year&rsquo;s
morning, and I&rsquo;ll warrant that randy Kate is sound asleep
yet,&rdquo; she said, and quickly clad herself and went to the
head of the stair and cried, &ldquo;Kate, Kate! are ye up yet,
Kate?&nbsp; Are ye hearing me, Kate MacNeill?&rdquo;</p>
<p>From the cavern dark of the lower storey there came back no
answer.</p>
<p>She stood with a curious twirly wooden candlestick in her hand
in the midst of a house that was dead dumb and desperate dark,
and smelled deliciously of things to eat.&nbsp; Even herself, who
had been at the making of most of them the day before, and had,
by God&rsquo;s grace, still much of a child&rsquo;s appetite,
could not but sniff with a childish satisfaction at this air of a
celestial grocery&mdash;of plum-puddings and currant-buns, apples
and oranges, cordials and spices, toffee and the angelic treacly
sweet we call Black Man,&mdash;her face lit rosily by the candle
lowe, a woman small and soft and sappy, with the most wanton
reddish hair, and a briskness of body that showed no sign as yet
of her accomplished years.&nbsp; What they were I will never tell
you; but this I&rsquo;ll say, that even if they had been eighty
she was the kind to cheerily dance quadrille.&nbsp; <a
name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>The daft bell,
so plainly in the jovial mood of Wanton Wully Oliver, infected
her: she smiled to herself in a way she had when remembering
droll things or just for simple jollity, and whoever saw Bell
Dyce smile to herself had never the least doubt after that she
was a darling.&nbsp; Over the tenements of the town the song of
the bell went rollicking, and in its hiccupping pauses went
wonderfully another sound far, far removed in spirit and
suggestion&mdash;the clang of wild geese calling: the
&ldquo;honk, honk&rdquo; of the ganders and the challenge of
their ladies come down adrift in the snow from the bitter
north.</p>
<p>But there was no answer from the maid in the kitchen.&nbsp;
She had rolled less deliberately than was usual from her blankets
to the summons of the six o&rsquo;clock bell, and already, with
the kitchen window open, her bounteous form surged over the two
sashes that were always so conveniently low and handy for a
gossip with any friendly passer-by on the pavement.&nbsp; She
drank the air of the clean chill morning dark, a heady thing like
old Tom Watson&rsquo;s autumn ale, full of the sentiment of the
daft days.&nbsp; She tilted an ear to catch the tune of the
mail-boy&rsquo;s song that now was echoing mellow from the
cobwebbed gloom of the stable stalls, and making a snowball from
the drift of the window-ledge she threw it, womanwise, aimlessly
into the street with a pretence at combat.&nbsp; The chill of the
snow stung sweet in the hot palm of her, for she was young and
strong.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kate, you wretch!&rdquo; cried a voice behind
her.&nbsp; She drew in her head, to find her mistress in the
kitchen with the candlestick in her hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, m&rsquo;em,&rdquo; cried the maid, no way abashed,
banging up the window and hurriedly crushing her more ample parts
under the final hooks and eyes of her morning
wrapper&mdash;&ldquo;oh, m&rsquo;em, what a start you gave
me!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m all in a p-p-palpitation.&nbsp; I was just
takin&rsquo; one mouthful of air and thinkin&rsquo; to myself
yonder in the Gaelic that it was time for me to be comin&rsquo;
in and risin&rsquo; right.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>&ldquo;A
Happy New Year to you, Kate MacNeill,&rdquo; said the mistress,
taking her hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just that, just that! and the same to you yourself,
Miss Dyce.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m feeling fine; I&rsquo;m that glad with
everything,&rdquo; said the maid, in some confusion at this
unusual relation with her mistress.&nbsp; She shook the proffered
hand rapidly from side to side as if it were an egg-switch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And see and get the fires on quick now, like a good
lass.&nbsp; It would never do to be starting the New Year
late,&mdash;it would be unlucky.&nbsp; I was crying to you yonder
from the stair-head, and wondering if you were ill, that you did
not answer me so quickly as you do for ordinar&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ill, Miss Dyce!&rdquo; cried the maid astounded.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Do you think I&rsquo;m daft to be ill on a New
Year&rsquo;s day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;After yon&mdash;after yon shortbread you ate yesterday
I would not have wondered much if you were,&rdquo; said Miss
Dyce, shaking her head solemnly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not
complaining, but, dear me! it was an awful lump; and I thought it
would be a bonny-like thing too, if our first-foot had to be the
doctor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doctor!&nbsp; I declare to goodness I never had need of
a doctor to me since Dr Macphee in Colonsay put me in order with
oil and things after I had the measles,&rdquo; exclaimed the
maid, as if mankind were like wag-at-the-wa&rsquo; clocks and
could be guaranteed to go right for years if you blew through
them with a pair of bellows, or touched their works with an oily
feather.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind about the measles just now, Kate,&rdquo;
said Miss Dyce, with a meaning look at the blackout fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither I was mindin&rsquo; them, m&rsquo;em,&mdash;I
don&rsquo;t care a spittle for them; it&rsquo;s so long ago I
would not know them if I saw them; I was just&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But get your fire on.&nbsp; You know we have a lot to
do to-day to get everything nice and ready for my nephew who
comes from America with the four o&rsquo;clock coach.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;America!&rdquo; cried the maid, dropping a saucepan <a
name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>lid on the
floor in her astonishment.&nbsp; &ldquo;My stars!&nbsp; Did I not
think it was from Chickagoo?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Chicago is in America, Kate,&rdquo; said her
mistress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it? is it?&nbsp; Mercy on me, how was Kate to
know?&nbsp; I only got part of my education,&mdash;up to the
place where you carry one and add ten.&nbsp; America!&nbsp; Dear
me, just fancy!&nbsp; The very place that I&rsquo;m so keen to go
to.&nbsp; If I had the money, and was in
America&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a familiar theme; Kate had not got fully started on it
when her mistress fled from the kitchen and set briskly about her
morning affairs.</p>
<p>And gradually the household of Dyce the lawyer awoke wholly to
a day of unaccustomed stillness and sound, for the deep snow
piled in the street and hushed the traffic of wheel, and hoof,
and shoe, but otherwise the morning was cheerful with New
Year&rsquo;s day noise.&nbsp; For the bell-ringing of Wanton
Wully was scarcely done, died down in a kind of brazen chuckle,
and the &ldquo;honk, honk&rdquo; of the wild geese sped seaward
over gardens and back lanes, strange wild music of the north,
far-fetched and undomestic,&mdash;when the fife band shrilly
tootled through the town to the tune of &ldquo;Hey, Johnny Cope,
are ye waukin&rsquo; yet?&rdquo;&nbsp; Ah, they were the proud,
proud men, their heads dizzy with glory and last night&rsquo;s
wine, their tread on air.&nbsp; John Taggart drummed&mdash;a
mighty drummer, drunk or sober, who so loved his instrument he
sometimes went to bed with it still fastened to his neck, and
banged to-day like Banagher, who banged furiously, never minding
the tune much, but happy if so be that he made noise
enough.&nbsp; And the fifers were not long gone down the town,
all with the wrong step but Johnny Vicar, as his mother thought,
when the snow was trampled under the feet of playing children,
and women ran out of their houses, and crossed the street, some
of them, I declare, to kiss each other, for &rsquo;tis a fashion
lately come, and most genteel, grown wonderfully common in
Scotland.&nbsp; Right down the middle of <a
name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>the town, with
two small flags in his hat and holly in the lapel of his coat,
went old Divine the hawker, with a great barrow of pure gold,
crying &ldquo;Fine Venetian oranges! wha&rsquo;ll buy sweet
Venetian oranges?&nbsp; Nane o&rsquo; your foreign trash.&nbsp;
Oranges!&nbsp; Oranges!&mdash;rale New Year oranges, three a
penny; bloods, a bawbee each!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The shops opened just for an hour for fear anybody might want
anything, and many there were, you may be sure, who did, for they
had eaten and drunken everything provided the night
before&mdash;which we call Hogmanay,&mdash;and now there were
currant-loaves and sweety biscuits to buy; shortcake, sugar and
lemons, ginger cordial for the boys and girls and United
Presbyterians, boiled ham for country cousins who might come
unexpected, and P. &amp; A. MacGlashan&rsquo;s threepenny
mutton-pies (twopence if you brought the ashet back), ordinarily
only to be had on fair-days and on Saturdays, and far renowned
for value.</p>
<p>Miss Minto&rsquo;s Millinery and Manteau Emporium was
discovered at daylight to have magically outlined its doors and
windows during the night with garlands and festoons of spruce and
holly, whereon the white rose bloomed in snow; and Miss Minto
herself, in a splendid crimson cloak down to the heels, and
cheeks like cherries, was standing with mittens and her five
finger-rings on, in the middle door, saying in beautiful gentle
English &ldquo;A Happy New Year&rdquo; to every one who
passed&mdash;even to George Jordon, the common cowherd, who was
always a little funny in his intellects, and, because his
trousers were bell-mouthed and hid his feet, could never remember
whether he was going to his work or coming from it, unless he
consulted the Schoolmaster.&nbsp; &ldquo;The same to you,
m&rsquo;em, excuse my hands,&rdquo; said poor George, just
touching the tips of her fingers.&nbsp; Then, because he had been
stopped and slewed a little from his course, he just went back
the way he had come.</p>
<p>Too late got up the red-faced sun, too late to laugh at Wanton
Wully&rsquo;s jovial bell, too late for Taggart&rsquo;s mighty
drumming, but a jolly winter sun,&mdash;&rsquo;twas all <a
name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>that was wanted
among the chimneys to make the day complete.</p>
<p>First of all to rise in Dyce&rsquo;s house, after the mistress
and the maid, was the master, Daniel Dyce himself.</p>
<p>And now I will tell you all about Daniel Dyce: it is that
behind his back he was known as Cheery Dan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your bath is ready, Dan,&rdquo; his sister had cried,
and he rose and went with chittering teeth to it, looked at it a
moment, and put a hand in the water.&nbsp; It was as cold as ice,
because that water, drinking which, men never age, comes from
high mountain bens.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That for ye to-day!&rdquo; said he to the bath,
snapping his fingers.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see ye far enough
first!&rdquo;&nbsp; And contented himself with a slighter wash
than usual, and shaving.&nbsp; As he shaved he hummed all the
time, as was his habit, an ancient air of his boyhood; to-day it
was</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Star of Peace, to wanderers
weary,&rdquo;</p>
<p>with not much tone but a great conviction,&mdash;a tall, lean,
clean-shaven man of over fifty, with a fine long nose, a ruddy
cheek, keen grey eyes, and plenty of room in his clothes, the
pockets of him so large and open it was no wonder so many people
tried, as it were, to put their hands into them.&nbsp; And when
he was dressed he did a droll thing, for from one of his pockets
he took what hereabouts we call a pea-sling, that to the rest of
the world is a catapult, and having shut one eye, and aimed with
the weapon, and snapped the rubber several times with amazing
gravity, he went upstairs into an attic and laid it on a table at
the window with a pencilled note, in which he wrote&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">A <span
class="smcap">New Year&rsquo;s Day Present</span><br />
<span class="smcap">for a Good Boy</span><br />
<span class="smcap">from</span><br />
<span class="smcap">An Uncle who does not like Cats</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He looked round the little room that seemed very bright and
cheerful, for its window gazed over the <a name="page8"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 8</span>garden to the east and to the valley
where was seen the King&rsquo;s highway.&nbsp; &ldquo;Wonderful!
wonderful!&rdquo; he said to himself.&nbsp; &ldquo;They have made
an extraordinary job of it.&nbsp; Very nice indeed, but just a
shade ladylike.&nbsp; A stirring boy would prefer fewer
fal-lals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was little indeed to suggest the occupation of a
stirring boy in that attic, with its draped dressing-table in
lilac print, its looking-glass flounced in muslin and pink
lover&rsquo;s-knots, its bower-like bed canopied and curtained
with green lawn, its shy scent of pot-pourri and lavender.&nbsp;
A framed text in crimson wools, the work of Bell Dyce when she
was in Miss Mushet&rsquo;s seminary, hung over the mantelpiece
enjoining all beholders to</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">Watch and
Pray</span>.</p>
<p>Mr Dyce put both hands into his trousers pockets, bent a
little, and heaved in a sort of chirruping laughter.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Man&rsquo;s whole duty, according to Bell Dyce,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;&lsquo;Watch and Pray&rsquo;; but they do not need
to have the lesson before them continually yonder in Chicago,
I&rsquo;ll warrant.&nbsp; Yon&rsquo;s the place for watching, by
all accounts, however it may be about the prayer.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Watch and Pray&rsquo;&mdash;h&rsquo;m!&nbsp; It should be
Watch <i>or</i> Pray&mdash;it clearly cannot be both at once with
the world the way it is; you might as well expect a man to eat
pease-meal and whistle strathspeys at the same time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was humming &ldquo;Star of Peace&rdquo;&mdash;for the tune
he started the morning with usually lasted him all day,&mdash;and
standing in the middle of the floor contemplating with amusement
the ladylike adornment of the room prepared for his Chicago
nephew, when a light step fell on the attic stairs, and a
woman&rsquo;s voice cried, &ldquo;Dan!&nbsp; Dan Dyce!&nbsp;
Coo-ee!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did not answer.</p>
<p>She cried again after coming up a step or two more, but still
he did not answer.&nbsp; He slid behind one of the
bed-curtains.</p>
<h2><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>CHAPTER
II.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Alison Dyce</span> came lightly up the
rest of the stair, whistling blithely, in spite of her sister
Bell&rsquo;s old notion that whistling women and crowing hens are
never canny.&nbsp; She swept into the room.&nbsp; People in the
town&mdash;which has a forest of wood and deer behind
it&mdash;used to say she had the tread and carriage of a young
wild roe, and I can well assure you she was the girl to walk with
on a winter day!&nbsp; She had in her hand a book of poems called
&lsquo;The Golden Treasury&rsquo; and a spray of the herb called
Honesty, that thrives in poor men&rsquo;s gardens.&nbsp; Having
laid them down on the table without noticing her brother&rsquo;s
extraordinary Present for a Good Boy, she turned about and
fondled things.&nbsp; She smoothed the bed-clothes as if they
covered a child, she patted the chair-backs with an air of
benediction, she took cushions to her breast like one that
cuddled them, and when she touched the mantel-piece ornaments
they could not help it but must start to chime.&nbsp; It was
always a joy to see Alison Dyce redding-up, as we say; though in
housewifery, like sewing, knitting, and cooking, she was only a
poor second to her sister Bell.&nbsp; She tried, from duty, to
like these occupations, but, oh dear! the task was beyond her:
whatever she had learned from her schooling in Edinburgh and
Brussels, it was not the darning of hose and the covering of
rhubarb-tarts.</p>
<p>Her gift, said Bell, was management.</p>
<p>Tripping round the little attic, she came back by-and-by to
the table at the window to take one last wee glimpse inside
&lsquo;The Golden Treasury,&rsquo; that was <a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>her own
delight and her notion of happy half-hours for the ideal boy, and
her eye fell for the first time on the pea-sling and the note
beside it.</p>
<p>She read, and laughed, and upon my word, if laughter like
Ailie Dyce&rsquo;s could be bought in perforated rolls, there
would be no demand for Chopin and Schumann on the pianolas.&nbsp;
It was a laugh that even her brother could not resist: a paroxysm
of coughing burst from behind the curtains, and he came out
beside her chuckling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckoned without my hoast,&rdquo; said he,
gasping.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was sure you were upstairs,&rdquo; said Alison.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You silly man!&nbsp; Upon my word!&nbsp; Where&rsquo;s
your dignity, Mr Dyce?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan Dyce stood for a second a little bit abashed, rubbing his
chin and blinking his eyes as if their fun was a thing to be kept
from brimming over.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a great wag!&rdquo;
said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s dignity you&rsquo;re after,
just look at my velvet coat!&rdquo; and so saying he caught the
ends of his coat skirts with his fingers, held them out at
arm&rsquo;s-length, and turned round as he might do at a fit-on
in his tailor&rsquo;s, laughing till his hoast came on
again.&nbsp; &ldquo;Dignity, quo&rsquo; she, just look at my
velvet coat!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dan, Dan! will you never be wise?&rdquo; said Ailie
Dyce, a humorsome demoiselle herself, if you believe me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not if I keep my health,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You have made a bonny-like show of the old garret, between
the two of you.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s as smart as a lass at her first
ball.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s very nice; at least it might be
worse,&rdquo; interrupted Alison defensively, glancing round with
satisfaction and an eye to the hang of the frame round
&ldquo;Watch and Pray.&rdquo;&nbsp; Bell&rsquo;s wool-work never
agreed with her notions, but, as she knew that her tarts never
agreed with Bell, she kept, on that point, aye discreetly
dumb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor little Chicago!&rdquo; said her brother.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m vexed for the wee fellow.&nbsp; Print chintz, or
chint <a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
11</span>prints, or whatever it is; sampler texts, and scent, and
poetry books&mdash;what in the world is the boy to
break?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you have seen to that department, Dan!&rdquo; said
Ailie, taking the pea-sling again in her hand.&nbsp;
&ldquo;&lsquo;A New Year&rsquo;s Day Present for a Good Boy from
an Uncle who does not like Cats.&rsquo;&nbsp; I declare that
<i>is</i> a delightful way of making the child feel quite at home
at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tuts!&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis just a diversion.&nbsp; I know
it&rsquo;ll cheer him wonderfully to find at the start that if
there&rsquo;s no young folk in the house there&rsquo;s some of
the eternal Prank.&nbsp; I suppose there are cats in
Chicago.&nbsp; He cannot expect us to provide him with pigs,
which are the usual domestic pets there, I believe.&nbsp; You let
my pea-sling alone, Ailie; you&rsquo;ll find it will please him
more than all the poetry and pink bows.&nbsp; I was once a boy
myself, and I know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were never anything else,&rdquo; said Alison.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And never will be anything else.&nbsp; It is a pity to let
the child see at the very start what an irresponsible person his
uncle is; and besides, it&rsquo;s cruel to throw stones at
cats.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all, not at all!&rdquo; said her brother
briskly, with his head quizzically to the side a little, in a way
he had when debating in the Court.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have been
throwing stones for twenty years at those cats of Rodger&rsquo;s
that live in our garden and I never hit one yet.&nbsp;
They&rsquo;re all about six inches too short for genuine
sport.&nbsp; If cats were Dachshund dogs, and I wasn&rsquo;t so
fond of dogs, I would be deadly.&nbsp; But my ado with cats is
just one of the manly old British sports, like trout-fishing and
curling.&nbsp; You take your fun out in anticipation, and the
only difference is you never need to carry a flask.&nbsp; Still,
I&rsquo;m not without hope that my nephew from Chicago may have a
better aim than I have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are an old&mdash;an old goose, Dan Dyce, and a
Happy New Year to you!&rdquo; said his sister, putting her arms
suddenly round his neck and kissing him.</p>
<p><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>&ldquo;Tuts! the coming of that child&rsquo;s
ta&rsquo;en your head,&rdquo; said the brother, reddening, for
sisters never kiss their own brothers in our
part,&mdash;it&rsquo;s so sentimental, it&rsquo;s so like the
penny stories.&nbsp; &ldquo;A Good New Year to you, Ailie,&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Tuts!&rdquo; he said again, looking quite upset, till
Ailie laughed and put her arm through his and drew him downstairs
to the breakfast to which she had come to summon him.</p>
<p>The Chicago child&rsquo;s bedroom, left to itself, chilly a
bit like Highland weather, but honest and clean, looked more like
a bower than ever: the morning sun, peeping over garden trees and
the chimneys of the lanes, gazed particularly on the table where
the pea-sling and the poetry book lay together.</p>
<p>And now the town was thronged like a fair-day, with such
stirring things happening every moment in the street that the
servant, Kate, had a constant head out at the window,
&ldquo;putting by the time,&rdquo; as she explained to the
passing inquirer, &ldquo;till the Mustress would be ready for the
breakfast.&rdquo;&nbsp; That was Kate,&mdash;she had come from an
island where they make the most of everything that may be news,
even if it&rsquo;s only brandy-sauce to pudding at the
minister&rsquo;s; and Miss Dyce could not start cutting a new
bodice or sewing a button on her brother&rsquo;s trousers but the
maid billowed out upon the window-sash to tell the tidings to the
first of her sex that passed.</p>
<p>Over the trodden snow she saw the people from the country
crowd in their Sunday clothes, looking pretty early in the day
for gaiety, all with scent on their handkerchiefs (which is the
odour of festive days for a hundred miles round burgh towns); and
town people, less splendid in attire, as folk that know the
difference between a holiday and a Sabbath, and leave their
religious hard hats at home on a New Year&rsquo;s day; children,
too, replete with bun already, and all succulent with the juice
of Divine&rsquo;s oranges.&nbsp; She heard the bell begin to peal
again, for Wully Oliver&mdash;fie on Wully Oliver!&mdash;had been
met by some boys who told him the six o&rsquo;clock bell was not
yet <a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>rung,
and sent him back to perform an office he had done with hours
before.&nbsp; He went to his bell dubiously, something in the
dizzy abyss he called his mind that half convinced him he had
rung it already.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me pause and consider,&rdquo; he said once or twice
when being urged to the rope, scratching the hair behind his ears
with both hands, his gesture of reflection.&nbsp; &ldquo;Was
there no&rsquo; a bairn&mdash;an auld-fashioned
bairn&mdash;helped to ca&rsquo; the bell already, and wanted to
gie me money for the chance?&nbsp; It runs in my mind there was a
bairn, and that she had us aye boil-boiling away at eggs; but
maybe I&rsquo;m wrong, for I&rsquo;ll admit I had a dram or two
and lost the place.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t believe in
dram-dram-dramming, but I aye say if you take a dram, take it in
the morning and you get the good of it all day.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
a tip I learned in the Crimea.&rdquo;&nbsp; But at last they
convinced him the bairn was just imagination, and Wanton Wully
Oliver spat on his hands and grasped the rope, and so it happened
that the morning bell on the New Year&rsquo;s day on which my
story opens was twice rung.</p>
<p>The Dyce handmaid heard it pealing as she hung over the
window-sash with her cap agee on her head.&nbsp; She heard from
every quarter&mdash;from lanes, closes, tavern rooms, high
attics, and back-yards&mdash;fifes playing; it was as if she
leaned over a magic grove of great big birds, each singing its
own song&mdash;&ldquo;Come to the Bower,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;Monymusk,&rdquo; or &ldquo;The Girl I left Behind
Me,&rdquo; noble airs wherein the captain of the band looked for
a certain perfection from his musicians before they marched out
again at midday.&nbsp; &ldquo;For,&rdquo; said he often in
rehearsals, &ldquo;anything will do in the way of a tune in the
dark, my sunny boys, but it must be the tiptop of skill, and no
discordancy, when the eyes of the world are on us.&nbsp; One turn
more at &lsquo;Monymusk,&rsquo; sunny boys, and then we&rsquo;ll
have a skelp at yon tune of my own composure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Besides the sound of the bell and the universal practice of
the fifes there were loud vocalists at the <a
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>Cross, and
such laughter in the street that Kate was in an ecstasy.&nbsp;
Once, uplifted beyond all private decorum, she kilted her gown
and gave a step of a reel in her kitchen solitude.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it cheery, the noise!&rdquo; she exclaimed
delightly to the letter-carrier who came to the window with the
morning&rsquo;s letters.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, I am feeling
beautiful!&nbsp; It is&mdash;it is&mdash;it is just like being
inside a pair of bagpipes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was a man who roared, the postman, being used to bawling up
long common-stairs in the tenements for the people to come down
to the foot themselves for their letters&mdash;a man with one
roguish eye for the maiden and another at random.&nbsp; Passing
in the letters one by one, he said in tones that on a quieter day
might be heard half up the street, &ldquo;Nothing for you,
yourself, personally, Kate, but maybe there&rsquo;ll be one
to-morrow.&nbsp; Three big blue anes and seven wee anes for the
man o&rsquo; business himsel&rsquo;, twa for Miss Dyce
(she&rsquo;s the wonderfu&rsquo; correspondent!), and ane for
Miss Alison wi&rsquo; the smell o&rsquo; scented perfume
on&rsquo;t&mdash;that&rsquo;ll be frae the Miss Birds o&rsquo;
Edinburgh.&nbsp; And I near forgot&mdash;here&rsquo;s a
post-caird for Miss Dyce: hearken to this&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Child arrived Liverpool yesterday; left this
morning for Scotland.&nbsp; Quite safe to go alone, charge of
conductor.&nbsp; Pip, pip!&nbsp; Molyneux.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatna child is it, Kate?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Pip, pip!&rsquo;&nbsp; What in the world&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Pip, pip&rsquo;?&nbsp; The child is brother
William&rsquo;s child, to be sure,&rdquo; said Kate, who always
referred to the Dyce relations as if they were her own.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You have heard of brother William?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Him that was married on the play-actress and never
wrote home?&rdquo; shouted the letter-carrier.&nbsp; &ldquo;He
went away before my time.&nbsp; Go on; quick, for I&rsquo;m in a
desperate hurry this mornin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he died abroad in Chickagoo.&nbsp; God have <a
name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>mercy on him
dying so far away from home, and him without a word of Gaelic in
his head! and a friend o&rsquo; his father &rsquo;s bringing the
boy home to his aunties.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where in the world&rsquo;s Chickagoo?&rdquo; bellowed
the postman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In America, of course,&mdash;where else would it be but
in America?&rdquo; said Kate contemptuously.&nbsp; &ldquo;Where
is your education not to know that Chickagoo is in America, where
the servant-maids have a pound a-week of wages, and learn the
piano, and can get married when they like quite easy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bless me! do you say so?&rdquo; cried the postman in
amazement, and not without a pang of jealousy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I say so!&rdquo; said Kate in the snappish style
she often showed to the letter-carrier.&nbsp; &ldquo;And the
child is coming this very day with the coach-and-twice from
Maryfield railway station&mdash;oh them trains! them trains! with
their accidents; my heart is in my mouth to think of a child in
them.&nbsp; Will you not come round to the back and get the
Mustress&rsquo;s New Year dram?&nbsp; She is going to give a New
Year dram to every man that calls on business this day.&nbsp; But
I will not let you in, for it is in my mind that you would not be
a lucky first-foot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Much obleeged,&rdquo; said the postman, &ldquo;but ye
needna be feared.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not allowed to go dramming at
my duty.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s offeecial, and I canna help it.&nbsp;
If it was not offeecial, there&rsquo;s few letter-carriers that
wouldna need to hae iron hoops on their heids to keep their
brains from burstin&rsquo; on the day efter New Year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate heard a voice behind her, and pulled her head in
hurriedly with a gasp, and a cry of &ldquo;Mercy, the start I
got!&rdquo; while the postman fled on his rounds.&nbsp; Miss Dyce
stood behind, in the kitchen, indignant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a perfect heartbreak, Kate,&rdquo; said the
mistress.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have rung for breakfast twice, and you
<a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>never
heard me, with your clattering out there to the
letter-carrier.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a pity you cannot marry the glee
party, as Mr Dyce calls him, and be done with it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me marry him!&rdquo; cried the maid indignantly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I think I see myself marryin&rsquo; a man like yon, and
his eyes not neighbours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a trifle in a husband if his heart is
good: the letter-carrier&rsquo;s eyes may&mdash;may skew a
little, but it&rsquo;s not to be wondered at, considering the
look-out he has to keep on all sides of him to keep out of reach
of every trollop in the town who wants to marry him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And leaving Kate speechless at this accusation, the mistress
of the house took the letters from her hands and went to the
breakfast-table with them.</p>
<p>She had read the contents of the post-card before she reached
the parlour; its news dismayed her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just imagine!&rdquo; she cried.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s that bairn on his way from Liverpool his
lee-lone, and not a body with him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! what!&rdquo; cried Mr Dyce, whose eyes had been
shut to say the grace.&nbsp; &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that
actor-fellow, Molyneux, coming with him, as he
promised?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Dyce sunk in a chair and burst into tears, crushing the
post-card in her hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does he say?&rdquo; demanded her brother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He says&mdash;he says&mdash;oh, dear me!&mdash;he says
&lsquo;Pip, pip!&rsquo;&rdquo; quoth the weeping sister.</p>
<h2><a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
17</span>CHAPTER III.</h2>
<p>&ldquo;I <span class="smcap">misdoubted</span> Mr Molyneux
from the very first,&rdquo; said Ailie, turning as white as a
clout.&nbsp; &ldquo;From all his post-cards he was plainly too
casual.&nbsp; Stop it, Bell, my dear&mdash;have sense; the
child&rsquo;s in a Christian land, and in care of somebody who is
probably more dependable than this delightful
Molyneux.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr Dyce took out an old, thick, silver verge.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Nine o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; he said, with a glance at its
creamy countenance.&nbsp; &ldquo;Molyneux&rsquo;s consignment is
making his first acquaintance with Scottish scenery and finding
himself, I hope, amused at the Edinburgh accent.&nbsp;
He&rsquo;ll arrive at Maryfield&mdash;poor wee smout!&mdash;at
three; if I drive over at twelve, I&rsquo;ll be in time to meet
him.&nbsp; Tuts, Bell, give over; he&rsquo;s a ten-year-old and a
Dyce at that,&mdash;there&rsquo;s not the slightest fear of
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ten years old, and in a foreign country&mdash;if you
can call Scotland a foreign country,&rdquo; cried Miss Dyce,
still sobbing with anger and grief.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, the
cat-witted scamp, that Molyneux,&mdash;if I had him
here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The dining-room door opened and let in a yawning dog of most
plebeian aspect, longest lie-abed of the household, the clamour
of the street, and the sound of sizzling bacon, followed by
Kate&rsquo;s majestic form at a stately glide, because she had on
her new stiff lilac print that was worn for breakfast only on
Sundays and holidays.&nbsp; &ldquo;You would think I was never
coming,&rdquo; she said genially, and smiled widely as she put
the tray on the sideboard.&nbsp; This that I <a
name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>show you, I
fear, is a beggarly household, absurdly free from ceremony.&nbsp;
Mr Dyce looked at his sister Ailie and smiled; Ailie looked at
her sister Bell and smiled.&nbsp; Bell took a hairpin or two out
of their places and seemed to stab herself with them viciously in
the nape of the neck, and smiled not at all nor said anything,
for she was furious with Molyneux, whom she could see in her
mind&rsquo;s eye&mdash;an ugly, tippling, frowsy-looking person
with badly polished boots, an impression that would have greatly
amused Mrs Molyneux, who, not without reason, counted her Jim the
handsomest man and the best dressed in the profession in all
Chicago.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m long of coming, like Royal Charlie,&rdquo;
Kate proceeded, as she passed the ashets on to Miss Dyce;
&ldquo;but, oh me! New Year&rsquo;s day here is no&rsquo; like
New Year&rsquo;s day in the bonny isle of Colonsay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr Dyce said grace and abstractedly helped himself alternately
from both ends of a new roll of powdered butter.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Dan, dear, don&rsquo;t take the butter from both
ends,&mdash;it spoils the look,&rdquo; said Bell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tuts!&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the
odds?&nbsp; There&rsquo;ll be no ends at all when we&rsquo;re
done with it.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m utterly regardless of the
symmetrical and the beautiful this morning.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m
savage to think of that man Molyneux.&nbsp; If I was not a man of
peace I would be wanting to wring Mr Molyneux&rsquo;s
neck,&rdquo; and he twisted his morning roll in halves with
ferocious hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dan!&rdquo; said Ailie, shocked.&nbsp; &ldquo;I never
heard you say anything so bloodthirsty in all my life
before.&nbsp; I would never have thought it of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe not,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
many things about me you never suspected.&nbsp; You women are
always under delusions about the men&mdash;about the
men&mdash;well, dash it! about the men you like.&nbsp; I know
myself so well that there is no sin, short of one or two not so
accounted, that I cannot think myself capable of.&nbsp; I believe
I might be forced into robbing a kirk if I had no money and was
as hungry <a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
19</span>as I was this morning before that post-card came to ruin
a remarkably fine New-Year&rsquo;s-day appetite, or even into
murdering a man like Molyneux who failed in the simplest duties
no man should neglect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope and trust,&rdquo; said Bell, still nervous,
&ldquo;that he is a wiselike boy with a proper upbringing, who
will not be frightened at travelling and make no mistakes about
the train.&nbsp; If he was a Scotch laddie, with the fear of God
in him, I would not be a bit put about for him, for he would be
sure to be asking, asking, and if he felt frightened he would
just start and eat something, like a Christian.&nbsp; But this
poor child has no advantages.&nbsp; Just American!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ailie sat back in her chair, with her teacup in her hand, and
laughed, and Kate laughed quietly&mdash;though it beat her to see
where the fun was; and the dog laughed likewise&mdash;at least it
wagged its tail and twisted its body and made such extraordinary
sounds in its throat that you could say it was laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tuts! you are the droll woman, Bell,&rdquo; said Mr
Dyce, blinking at her.&nbsp; &ldquo;You have the daftest ideas of
some things.&nbsp; For a woman who spent so long a time in Miss
Mushet&rsquo;s seminary and reads so much at the newspapers, I
wonder at you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course his father was Scotch, that&rsquo;s one
mercy,&rdquo; added Bell, not a bit annoyed at the reception of
her pious opinions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is always something to be going on with,&rdquo;
said Mr Dyce mockingly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I hope he&rsquo;ll make the
most of that great start in life and fortune.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s as
good as money in his pocket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bell put up a tiny hand and pushed a stray curl (for she had a
rebel chevelure) behind her ear, and smiled in spite of her
anxiety about the coming nephew.&nbsp; &ldquo;You may laugh if
you like, Dan,&rdquo; she said emphatically, perking with her
head across the table at him; &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m <i>proud</i>,
I&rsquo;m <span class="GutSmall">PROUD</span>, I&rsquo;m PROUD
I&rsquo;m Scotch.&rdquo;&nbsp; (&ldquo;Not apologising for it
myself,&rdquo; said her brother softly.)&nbsp; &ldquo;And you
know what these <a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
20</span>Americans are!&nbsp; Useless bodies, who make their men
brush their own boots, and have to pay wages that&rsquo;s a sin
to housemaids, and eat pie even-on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear me! is that true, or did you see it in a
newspaper?&rdquo; said her brother.&nbsp; &ldquo;I begin to be
alarmed myself at the possibilities of this small gentleman now
on his way to the north, in the complete confidence of Mr
Molyneux, who must think him very clever.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a land
of infant prodigies he comes from; even at the age of ten he may
have more of the stars and stripes in him than we can eradicate
by a diet of porridge and a curriculum of Shorter Catechism and
Jane Porter&rsquo;s &lsquo;Scottish Chiefs.&rsquo;&nbsp; Faith, I
was fond of Jane myself when I read her first: she was nice and
bloody.&nbsp; A big soft hat with a bash in it, perhaps; a
rhetorical delivery at the nose, &lsquo;I guess and
calculate&rsquo; every now and then; a habit of chewing
tobacco&rdquo; (&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll need a cuspidor,&rdquo; said
Ailie <i>sotto voce</i>); &ldquo;and a revolver in his wee
hip-pocket.&nbsp; Oh, the darling!&nbsp; I can see him quite
plainly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mercy on us!&rdquo; cried the maid Kate, and fled the
room all in a tremor at the idea of the revolver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may say what you like, but I cannot get over his
being an American,&rdquo; said Bell solemnly.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
dollar&rsquo;s everything in America, and they&rsquo;re so
independent!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Terrible! terrible!&rdquo; said her brother ironically,
breaking into another egg fiercely with his knife, as if he were
decapitating the President of the United States.</p>
<p>Ailie laughed again.&nbsp; &ldquo;Dear, dear Bell!&rdquo; she
said, &ldquo;it sounds quite Scotch.&nbsp; A devotion to the
dollar is a good sound basis for a Scotch character.&nbsp;
Remember there are about a hundred bawbees in a dollar: just
think of the dollar in bawbees, and you&rsquo;ll not be surprised
that the Americans prize it so much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Renegade!&rdquo; said Bell, shaking a spoon at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Provincial!&rdquo; retorted Ailie, shaking a fork at
Bell.</p>
<p class="poetry"><a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
21</span>&ldquo;&lsquo;Star of Peace, to wanderers weary,<br />
Bright the beams that shine on me,&rsquo;</p>
<p>&mdash;children, be quiet,&rdquo; half-sung, half-said their
brother.&nbsp; &ldquo;Bell, you are a blether; Ailie, you are a
cosmopolitan, a thing accursed.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what Edinburgh
and Brussels and your too brisk head have done for you.&nbsp;
Just bring yourself to our poor parochial point of view, and tell
me, both of you, what you propose to do with this young gentleman
from Chicago when you get him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Change his stockings and give him a good tea,&rdquo;
said Bell promptly, as if she had been planning it for
weeks.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be starving of hunger and damp
with snow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s something more than dry hose and high tea
to the making of a man,&rdquo; said her brother.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
can&rsquo;t keep that up for a dozen years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you mean education!&rdquo; said Bell
resignedly.&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not in my department at
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ailie expressed her views with calm, soft deliberation, as if
she, too, had been thinking of nothing else for weeks, which was
partly the case.&nbsp; &ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;he&rsquo;ll go to the Grammar School, and get a good
grounding on the classic side, and then to the University.&nbsp;
I will just love to help him so long as he&rsquo;s at the Grammar
School.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what I should have been, Dan, if you
had let me&mdash;a teacher.&nbsp; I hope he&rsquo;s a bright boy,
for I simply cannot stand what Bell
calls&mdash;calls&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Diffies,&rdquo; suggested Bell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Diffies; yes, I can <i>not</i> stand diffies.&nbsp;
Being half a Dyce I can hardly think he will be a diffy.&nbsp; If
he&rsquo;s the least like his father, he may be a little wild at
first, but at least he&rsquo;ll be good company, which makes up
for a lot, and good-hearted, quick in perception, fearless,
and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And awful funny,&rdquo; suggested Bell, beaming with
old, fond, glad recollections of the brother dead beside his
actor wife in far Chicago.</p>
<p><a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
22</span>&ldquo;Fearless, and good fun,&rdquo; continued
Ailie.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, dear Will! what a merry soul he
was.&nbsp; Well, the child cannot be a fool if he&rsquo;s like
his father.&nbsp; American independence, though he has it
in&mdash;in&mdash;in clods, won&rsquo;t do him any harm at
all.&nbsp; I love Americans&mdash;do you hear that, Bell
Dyce?&mdash;because they beat that stupid old King George, and
have been brave in the forest and wise on the prairie, and feared
no face of king, and laughed at dynasties.&nbsp; I love them
because they gave me Emerson, and Whitman, and Thoreau, and
because one of them married my brother William, and was the
mother of his child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan Dyce nodded; he never quizzed his sister Ailie when it was
her heart that spoke and her eyes were sparkling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first thing you should learn him,&rdquo; said Miss
Dyce, &ldquo;is &lsquo;God save the Queen.&rsquo;&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s a splendid song altogether; I&rsquo;m glad I&rsquo;m
of a kingdom every time I hear it at a meeting, for it&rsquo;s
all that&rsquo;s left of the olden notions the Dyces died young
or lost their money for.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll learn him that,
Ailie, or I&rsquo;ll be very vexed with you.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll put
flesh on his bones with my cooking if you put the gentleman in
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Bell&rsquo;s idea that a gentleman talked a very fine
English accent like Ailie, and carried himself stately like
Ailie, and had wise and witty talk for rich or poor like
Ailie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not so sure about the university,&rdquo; she
went on.&nbsp; &ldquo;Such stirks come out of it sometimes; look
at poor Maclean, the minister!&nbsp; They tell me he could speak
Hebrew if he got anybody to speak it back slow to him, but just
imagine the way he puts on his clothes!&nbsp; And his wife
manages him not so bad in broad Scotch.&nbsp; I think we could do
nothing better than make the boy a lawyer; it&rsquo;s a trade
looked up to, and there&rsquo;s money in it, though I never could
see the need of law myself if folk would only be agreeable.&nbsp;
He could go into Dan&rsquo;s office whenever he is old
enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A lawyer!&rdquo; cried her brother.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
have first of all to see that he&rsquo;s not an ass.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
23</span>&ldquo;And what odds would that make to a lawyer?&rdquo;
said Bell quickly, snapping her eyes at the brother she honestly
thought the wisest man in Scotland.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bell,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;as I said before,
you&rsquo;re a haivering body&mdash;nothing else, though
I&rsquo;ll grant you bake no&rsquo; a bad scone.&nbsp; And as for
you, Ailie, you&rsquo;re beginning, like most women, at the wrong
end.&nbsp; The first thing to do with your nephew is to teach him
to be happy, for it&rsquo;s a habit that has to be acquired
early, like the liking for pease-brose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You began gey early yourself,&rdquo; said Bell.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Mother used to say that she was aye kittling your feet
till you laughed when you were a baby.&nbsp; I sometimes think
that she did not stop it soon enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I had to educate myself again, and had not a living
to make, I would leave out a good many things the old dominie
thought needful.&nbsp; What was yon awful thing
again?&mdash;mensuration.&nbsp; To sleep well and eat anything,
fear the face of nobody in bashfulness, to like dancing, and be
able to sing a good bass or tenor,&mdash;that&rsquo;s no bad
beginning in the art of life.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a fellow Brodie
yonder in the kirk choir who seems to me happier than a king when
he&rsquo;s getting in a fine boom-boom of bass to the tune
Devizes; he puts me all out at my devotions on a Lord&rsquo;s day
with envy of his accomplishment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! envy too!&rdquo; said Alison.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Murder, theft, and envy&mdash;what a brother!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, envy too, the commonest and ugliest of our
sins,&rdquo; said Mr Dyce.&nbsp; &ldquo;I never met man or woman
who lacked it, though many never know they have it.&nbsp; I hope
the great thing is to be ashamed to feel it, for that&rsquo;s all
that I can boast of myself.&nbsp; When I was a boy at the school
there was another boy, a great friend of my own, was chosen to
compete for a prize I was thought incapable of taking, so that I
was not on the list.&nbsp; I envied him to hatred&mdash;almost;
and saying my bits of prayers at night I prayed that he might
win.&nbsp; I felt ashamed of my envy, and set the better Daniel
Dyce to wrestle with the Daniel Dyce who was not quite so <a
name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>big.&nbsp; It
was a sair fight, I can assure you.&nbsp; I found the words of my
prayer and my wishes considerably at variance&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like me and &lsquo;Thy will be done&rsquo; when we got
the word of brother William,&rdquo; said Bell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But my friend&mdash;dash him!&mdash;got the
prize.&nbsp; I suppose God took a kind of vizzy down that night
and saw the better Dan Dyce was doing his desperate best against
the other devil&rsquo;s-Dan, who mumbled the prayer on the chance
He would never notice.&nbsp; There was no other way of accounting
for it, for that confounded boy got the prize, and he was not
half so clever as myself, and that was Alick Maitland.&nbsp; Say
nothing about envy, Ailie; I fear we all have some of it until we
are perhaps well up in years, and understand that between the
things we envy and the luck we have there is not much to
choose.&nbsp; If I got all I wanted, myself, the world would have
to be much enlarged.&nbsp; It does not matter a docken
leaf.&nbsp; Well, as I was saying when my learned friend
interrupted me, I would have this young fellow healthy and happy
and interested in everything.&nbsp; There are men I see who would
mope and weary in the middle of a country fair&mdash;God help
them!&nbsp; I want to stick pins in them sometimes and make them
jump.&nbsp; They take as little interest in life as if they were
undertakers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hoots! nobody could weary in this place at any
rate,&rdquo; said Bell briskly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Look at the life and
gaiety that&rsquo;s in it.&nbsp; Talk about London!&nbsp; I can
hardly get my sleep at night quite often with the traffic.&nbsp;
And such things are always happening in it&mdash;births and
marriages, engagements and tea-parties, new patterns at Miss
Minto&rsquo;s, two coaches in the day, and sometimes somebody
doing something silly that will keep you laughing half the
week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s not quite so lively as Chicago,&rdquo;
said Mr Dyce.&nbsp; &ldquo;There has not been a man shot in this
neighbourhood since the tinker kind of killed his wife (as the
fiscal says) with the pistol.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll have <a
name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>heard of
him?&nbsp; When the man was being brought on the scaffold for it,
and the minister asked if he had anything to say before he
suffered the extreme penalty of the law, &lsquo;All I have got to
say,&rsquo; he answered, starting to greet, &lsquo;is that
this&rsquo;ll be an awful lesson to me.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s one of your old ones,&rdquo; said Bell;
but even an old one was welcome in Dyce&rsquo;s house on New
Year&rsquo;s day, and the three of them laughed at the story as
if it had newly come from London in Ailie&rsquo;s precious
&lsquo;Punch.&rsquo;&nbsp; The dog fell into a convulsion of
merriment, as if inward chuckles tormented him&mdash;as queer a
dog as ever was, neither Scotch terrier nor Skye, Dandy Dinmont
nor Dachshund, but just dog,&mdash;dark wire-haired behind, short
ruddy-haired in front, a stump tail, a face so fringed you could
only see its eyes when the wind blew.&nbsp; Mr Dyce put down his
hand and scratched it behind the ear.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
laugh, Footles,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I would not laugh if
I were you, Footles,&mdash;it&rsquo;s just an old one.&nbsp; Many
a time you&rsquo;ve heard it before, sly rogue.&nbsp; One would
think you wanted to borrow money.&rdquo;&nbsp; If you could hear
Dan Dyce speak to his dog, you would know at once he was a
bachelor: only bachelors and bairnless men know dogs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope and trust he&rsquo;ll have decent clothes to
wear, and none of their American rubbish,&rdquo; broke in Bell,
back to her nephew again.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all nonsense
about the bashed hat; but you can never tell what way an American
play-actor will dress a bairn: there&rsquo;s sure to be something
daft-like about him&mdash;a starry waistcoat or a pair of
spats,&mdash;and we must make him respectable like other boys in
the place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would say Norfolk suits, the same as the
banker&rsquo;s boys,&rdquo; suggested Ailie.&nbsp; &ldquo;I think
the banker&rsquo;s boys always look so smart and neat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything with plenty of pockets in it,&rdquo; said Mr
Dyce.&nbsp; &ldquo;At the age of ten a boy would prefer his
clothes to be all pockets.&nbsp; By George! an entire suit of
pockets, with a new penny in every <a name="page26"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 26</span>pocket for luck, would be a great
treat,&rdquo;&mdash;and he chuckled at the idea, making a mental
note of it for a future occasion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stuff and nonsense!&rdquo; cried Bell emphatically, for
here she was in her own department.&nbsp; &ldquo;The boy is going
to be a Scotch boy.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll have the kilt on him, or
nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The kilt!&rdquo; said Mr Dyce.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The kilt!&rdquo; cried Ailie.</p>
<p>Rat-tat-tat-tat-tat-tat!</p>
<p>It was a loud knocking at the front door.&nbsp; They stopped
the talk to listen, and they heard the maid go along the lobby
from the kitchen.&nbsp; When she opened the door, there came in
the cheerful discord of the street, the sound of a pounding drum,
the fifes still busy, the orange-hawker&rsquo;s cry, but over all
they heard her put her usual interrogation to visitors, no matter
what their state or elegance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what is&rsquo;t?&rdquo; she asked, and though
they could not see her, they knew she would have the door just a
trifle open, with her shoulder against it, as if she was there to
repel some chieftain of a wild invading clan.&nbsp; Then they
heard her cry, &ldquo;Mercy on me!&rdquo; and her footsteps
hurrying to the parlour door.&nbsp; She threw it open, and stood
with some one behind her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think?&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s brother
William&rsquo;s wean!&rdquo; she exclaimed in a gasp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My God!&nbsp; Where is he?&rdquo; cried Bell, the first
to find her tongue.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;s no hurt, is
he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>It&rsquo;s no&rsquo; a him at all&mdash;it&rsquo;s a
her</i>!&rdquo; shrieked Kate, throwing up her arms in
consternation, and stepping aside she gave admission to a little
girl.</p>
<h2><a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
27</span>CHAPTER IV.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> orphan child of William and
Mary Dyce, dead, the pair of them, in the far-off city of
Chicago, stepped quite serenely into an astounded company.&nbsp;
There were three Dyces in a row in front of her, and the droll
dog Footles at her feet, and behind her, Kate, the servant,
wringing her apron as if it had newly come from the
washing-boyne, her bosom heaving.&nbsp; Ten eyes (if you could
count the dog&rsquo;s, hidden by his tousy fringe) stared at the
child a moment, and any ordinary child would have been much put
out; but this was no common child, or else she felt at once the
fond kind air of home.&nbsp; I will give you her picture in a
sentence or two.&nbsp; She was black-haired, dark and quick in
the eye, not quite pale but olive in complexion, with a chin she
held well up, and a countenance neither shy nor bold, but
self-possessed.&nbsp; Fur on her neck and hood (Jim
Molyneux&rsquo;s last gift), and a muff that held her arms up to
the elbows, gave her an aspect of picture-book cosiness that put
the maid in mind at once of the butcher&rsquo;s Christmas
calendar.</p>
<p>It was the dog that first got over the astonishment: he made a
dive at her with little friendly growls, and rolled on his back
at her feet, to paddle with his four paws in the air, which was
his way of showing he was in the key for fun.</p>
<p>With a cry of glee she threw the muff on the floor and plumped
beside him, put her arms about his body and buried her face in
his fringe.&nbsp; His tail went waving, joyous, like a
banner.&nbsp; &ldquo;Doggie, doggie, you <a
name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>love
me,&rdquo; said she in an accent that was anything but
American.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let us pause and consider,&mdash;you will
not leave this house till I boil you an egg.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God bless me, what child&rsquo;s this?&rdquo; cried
Bell, coming to herself with a start, and, pouncing on her, she
lifted her to her feet.&nbsp; Ailie sank on her hands and knees
and stared in the visitor&rsquo;s face.&nbsp; &ldquo;The kilt,
indeed!&rdquo; said Mr Dyce to himself.&nbsp; &ldquo;This must be
a warlock wean, for if it has not got the voice and sentiment of
Wanton Wully Oliver I&rsquo;m losing my wits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me this, quick, are you Lennox Dyce?&rdquo; said
Bell all trembling, devouring the little one with her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I just guess I am,&rdquo; replied the child
calmly, with the dog licking her chin.&nbsp; &ldquo;Say, are you
Auntie Bell?&rdquo; and this time there was no doubt about the
American accent.&nbsp; Up went her mouth to them to be kissed,
composedly: they lost no time, but fell upon her, Ailie half in
tears because at once she saw below the childish hood so much of
brother William.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lennox, dear, you should not speak like that; who in
all the world taught you to speak like that?&rdquo; said Bell,
unwrapping her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I thought that was all right here,&rdquo; said the
stranger.&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way the bell-man
speaks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bless me!&nbsp; Do you know the bell-man?&rdquo; cried
Miss Dyce.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I rang his old bell for him this
morning&mdash;didn&rsquo;t you hear me?&rdquo; was the surprising
answer.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a nice man; he liked me.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;d like him too if he wasn&rsquo;t so tired.&nbsp; He was
too tired to speak sense; all he would say was, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve
lost the place; let us pause and consider,&rsquo; and &lsquo;Try
another egg.&rsquo;&nbsp; I said I would give him a quarter if
he&rsquo;d let me ring his bell, and he said he&rsquo;d let me do
it for nothing, and my breakfast besides.&nbsp;
&lsquo;You&rsquo;ll not leave this house till I boil an egg for
you&rsquo;&mdash;that&rsquo;s what he said, and the poor man was
so tired and his legs <a name="page29"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 29</span>were dreff&rsquo;le
poorly!&rdquo;&nbsp; Again her voice was the voice of Wully
Oliver; the sentiment, as the Dyces knew, was the slogan of his
convivial hospitality.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The kilt, indeed!&rdquo; said Mr Dyce, feeling
extraordinarily foolish, and, walking past them, he went upstairs
and hurriedly put the pea-sling in his pocket.</p>
<p>When he came down, Young America was indifferently pecking at
her second breakfast with Footles on her knee, an aunt on either
side of her, and the maid Kate with a tray in her hand for
excuse, open-mouthed, half in at the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, as I was saying, Jim&mdash;that&rsquo;s my dear
Mr Molyneux, you know&mdash;got busy with a lot of the boys once
he landed off that old ship, and so he said, &lsquo;Bud, this is
the&mdash;the&mdash;justly cel&rsquo;brated Great Britain; I know
by the boys; they&rsquo;re so lonely when they&rsquo;re by
themselves; I was &rsquo;prehensive we might have missed it in
the dark, but it&rsquo;s all right.&rsquo;&nbsp; And next day he
bought me this muff and things and put me on the cars&mdash;say,
what funny cars you have!&mdash;and said &lsquo;Good-bye, Bud;
just go right up to Maryfield, and change there.&nbsp; If
you&rsquo;re lost anywhere on the island just holler out good and
loud, and I&rsquo;ll hear!&rsquo;&nbsp; He pretended he
wasn&rsquo;t caring, but he was pretty blinky &rsquo;bout the
eyes, and I saw he wasn&rsquo;t anyway gay, so I never let on the
way I felt myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She suggested the tone and manner of the absent Molyneux in a
fashion to put him in the flesh before them.&nbsp; Kate almost
laughed loud out at the oddity of it; Ailie and her brother were
astounded at the cleverness of the mimicry; Bell clenched her
hands, and said for the second time that day, &ldquo;Oh! that
Molyneux, if I had him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a nice man, Jim.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t tell
you how I love him&mdash;and he gave me heaps of candy at the
depot,&rdquo; proceeded the unabashed new-comer.&nbsp;
&ldquo;&lsquo;Change at Edinburgh,&rsquo; he said;
&lsquo;you&rsquo;ll maybe have time to run into the Castle and
see the Duke; give him my love, but not my address.&nbsp; When
you <a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>get to
Maryfield hop out slick and ask for your uncle Dyce.&rsquo;&nbsp;
And then he said, did Jim, &lsquo;I hope he ain&rsquo;t a loaded
Dyce, seein&rsquo; he&rsquo;s Scotch, and it&rsquo;s the festive
season.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The adorable Jim!&rdquo; said Ailie.&nbsp; &ldquo;We
might have known.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I got on all right,&rdquo; proceeded the child,
&ldquo;but I didn&rsquo;t see the Duke of Edinburgh; there
wasn&rsquo;t time, and uncle wasn&rsquo;t at Maryfield, but a man
put me on his mail carriage and drove me right here.&nbsp; He
said I was a caution.&nbsp; My! it was cold.&nbsp; Say, is it
always weather like this here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometimes it&rsquo;s like this, and sometimes
it&rsquo;s just ordinary Scotch weather,&rdquo; said Mr Dyce,
twinkling at her through his spectacles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was dreff&rsquo;le sleepy in the mail, and the driver
wrapped me up, and when I came into this town in the dark he
said, &lsquo;Walk right down there and rap at the first door you
see with a brass man&rsquo;s hand for a knocker; that&rsquo;s Mr
Dyce&rsquo;s house.&rsquo;&nbsp; I came down, and there
wasn&rsquo;t any brass man, but I saw the knocker.&nbsp; I
couldn&rsquo;t reach up to it, so when I saw a man going into the
church with a lantern in his hand, I went up to him and pulled
his coat.&nbsp; I knew he&rsquo;d be all right going into a
church.&nbsp; He told me he was going to ring the bell, and I
said I&rsquo;d give him a quarter&mdash;oh, I said that
before.&nbsp; When the bell was finished he took me to his house
for luck&mdash;that was what he said&mdash;and he and his wife
got right up and boiled eggs.&nbsp; They said I was a caution,
too, and they went on boiling eggs, and I couldn&rsquo;t eat more
than two and a white though I tried <i>and</i> tried.&nbsp; I
think I slept a good while in their house; I was so fatigued, and
they were all right; they loved me, I could see that.&nbsp; And I
liked them some myself, though they must be mighty poor, for they
haven&rsquo;t any children.&nbsp; Then the bell-man took me to
this house, and rapped at the door, and went away pretty quick
for him before anybody came to it, because he said he was
plain-soled&mdash;what&rsquo;s plain-soled <a
name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
31</span>anyhow?&mdash;and wasn&rsquo;t a lucky first-foot on a
New Year&rsquo;s morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It beats all, that&rsquo;s what it does!&rdquo; cried
Bell.&nbsp; &ldquo;My poor wee whitterick!&nbsp; Were ye
no&rsquo; frightened on the sea?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whitterick, whitterick,&rdquo; repeated the child to
herself, and Ailie, noticing, was glad that this was certainly
not a diffy.&nbsp; Diffies never interest themselves in new
words; diffies never go inside themselves with a new fact as a
dog goes under a table with a bone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were you not frightened when you were on the
sea?&rdquo; repeated Bell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the child promptly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Jim
was there all right, you see, and he knew all about it.&nbsp; He
said, &lsquo;Trust in Providence, and if it&rsquo;s <i>very</i>
stormy, trust in Providence and the Scotch
captain.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I declare! the creature must have some kind of sense in
him, too,&rdquo; said Bell, a little mollified by this compliment
to Scotch sea-captains.&nbsp; And all the Dyces fed their eyes
upon this wonderful wean that had fallen among them.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Twas happy in that hour with them; as if in a miracle they
had been remitted to their own young years; their dwelling was at
long last furnished!&nbsp; She had got into the good graces of
Footles as if she had known him all her life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, uncle, this is a funny dog,&rdquo; was her next
remark.&nbsp; &ldquo;Did God make him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;yes, I suppose God did,&rdquo; said Mr Dyce,
taken a bit aback.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, isn&rsquo;t He the darndest!&nbsp; This dog beats
Mrs Molyneux&rsquo;s Dodo, and Dodo was a looloo.&nbsp; What sort
of a dog is he?&nbsp; Scotch terrier?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mostly not,&rdquo; said her uncle, chuckling.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s really an improvement on the Scotch
terrier.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s later patents in him, you might
say.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s a sort of mosaic; indeed, when I think of
it you might describe him as a pure mosaic dog.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A Mosaic dog!&rdquo; exclaimed Lennox.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Then he must have come from scriptural parts.&nbsp;
Perhaps I&rsquo;ll <a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
32</span>get playing with him Sundays.&nbsp; Not playing loud
out, you know, but just being happy.&nbsp; I love being happy,
don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my only weakness,&rdquo; said Mr Dyce
emphatically, blinking through his glasses.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
other business men in the town don&rsquo;t approve of me for it;
they call it frivolity.&nbsp; But it comes so easily to me I
never charge it in the bills, though a sense of humour should
certainly be worth 12s. 6d. a smile in the Table of Fees.&nbsp;
It would save many a costly plea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you play on Sunday in Chicago?&rdquo;
asked Ailie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not out loud.&nbsp; Poppa said he was bound to have me
Scotch in one thing at least, even if it took a strap.&nbsp; That
was after mother died.&nbsp; He&rsquo;d just read to me Sundays,
and we went to church till we had pins and needles.&nbsp; We had
the Reverend Ebenezer Paul Frazer, M.A., Presbyterian Church on
the Front.&nbsp; He just preached and preached till we had pins
and needles all over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My poor Lennox!&rdquo; exclaimed Ailie, with
feeling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m all right!&rdquo; said young America
blithely.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not kicking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan Dyce, with his head to the side, took off his spectacles
and rubbed them clean with his handkerchief; put them on again,
looked at his niece through them, and then at Ailie, with some
emotion struggling in his countenance.&nbsp; Ailie for a moment
suppressed some inward convulsion, and turned her gaze,
embarrassed from him to Bell, and Bell catching the eyes of both
of them could contain her joy no longer.&nbsp; They laughed till
the tears came, and none more heartily than brother
William&rsquo;s child.&nbsp; She had so sweet a laugh that there
and then the Dyces thought it the loveliest sound they had ever
heard in their house.&nbsp; Her aunts would have devoured her
with caresses.&nbsp; Her uncle stood over her and beamed, rubbing
his hands, expectant every moment of another manifestation of the
oddest kind of child <a name="page33"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 33</span>mind he had ever encountered.&nbsp;
And Kate swept out and in between the parlour and the kitchen on
trivial excuses, generally with something to eat for the child,
who had eaten so much in the house of Wanton Wully Oliver that
she was indifferent to the rarest delicacies of Bell&rsquo;s
celestial grocery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re just&mdash;just a wee witch!&rdquo; said
Bell, fondling the child&rsquo;s hair.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you know,
that man Molyneux&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jim,&rdquo; suggested Lennox.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would Jim him if I had him!&nbsp; That man Molyneux
in all his scrimping little letters never said whether you were a
boy or a girl, and we thought a Lennox was bound to be a boy, and
all this time we have been expecting a boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I declare!&rdquo; said the little one, with the most
amusing drawl, a memory of Molyneux.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, I always
was a girl, far back as I can remember.&nbsp; Nobody never gave
me the chance to be a boy.&nbsp; I s&rsquo;pose I hadn&rsquo;t
the clothes for the part, and they just pushed me along anyhow in
frocks.&nbsp; Would you&rsquo;d rather I was a boy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a bit!&nbsp; We have one in the house already, and
he&rsquo;s a fair heart-break,&rdquo; said her aunt, with a look
towards Mr Dyce.&nbsp; &ldquo;We had just made up our minds to
dress you in the kilt when your rap came to the door.&nbsp; At
least, I had made up my mind; the others are so thrawn!&nbsp; And
bless me! lassie, where&rsquo;s your luggage?&nbsp; You surely
did not come all the way from Chicago with no more than what you
have on your back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be tickled to death to see my
trunks!&rdquo; said Lennox.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heaps and
heaps of clothes and six dolls.&nbsp; They&rsquo;re all coming
with the coach.&nbsp; They wanted me to wait for the coach too,
but the mail man who called me a caution said he was bound to
have a passenger for luck on New Year&rsquo;s day, and I was in a
hurry to get home anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Home!&rdquo;&nbsp; When she said that, the two aunts
swept on her like a billow and bore her, dog and all, <a
name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>upstairs to
her room.&nbsp; She was almost blind for want of sleep.&nbsp;
They hovered over her quick-fingered, airy as bees, stripping her
for bed.&nbsp; She knelt a moment and in one breath
said&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;God&mdash;bless&mdash;father&mdash;and&mdash;mother&mdash;and&mdash;Jim&mdash;and&mdash;Mrs

Molyneux&mdash;and&mdash;my&mdash;aunts&mdash;in&mdash;Scotland&mdash;and&mdash;Uncle&mdash;Dan&mdash;and&mdash;everybody&mdash;good-night&rdquo;</p>
<p>And was asleep in the sunlight of the room as soon as her head
fell on the pillow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She prayed for her father and mother,&rdquo; whispered
Bell, with Footles in her arms, as they stood beside the
bed.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not&mdash;it&rsquo;s not quite
Presbyterian to pray for the dead; it&rsquo;s very American,
indeed you might call it papist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ailie&rsquo;s face reddened, but she said nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And do you know this?&rdquo; said Bell shamefacedly,
&ldquo;I do it myself; upon my word, I do it myself.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m often praying for father and mother and
William.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So am I,&rdquo; confessed Alison, plainly
relieved.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;m a poor
Presbyterian, for I never knew there was anything wrong in doing
so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Below, in the parlour, Mr Dyce stood looking into the white
garden, a contented man, humming&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;Star of Peace, to wanderers
weary.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">She</span> was a lucky lassie, this of

New Year&rsquo;s day, for there is no denying that it is not
always gay in Scotland, contrairy land, that, whether we be deep
down in the waist of the world and afar from her, or lying on her
breast, chains us to her with links of iron and gold,&mdash;stern
tasks and happy days remembered, ancient stories, austerity and
freedom, cold weather on moor and glen, warm hearths and burning
hearts.&nbsp; She might have seen this burgh first in its
solemnity, on one of the winter days when it shivers and weeps
among its old memorials, and the wild geese cry more constant
over the house-tops, and the sodden gardens, lanes, wynds, and
wells, the clanging spirits of old citizens dead and gone,
haunting the place of their follies and their good times, their
ridiculous ideals, their mistaken ambitions, their broken
plans.&nbsp; Ah, wild geese! wild geese! old ghosts that cry
to-night above my dwelling, I feel&mdash;I feel and know!&nbsp;
She might have come, the child, to days of fast, and sombre dark
drugget garments, dissonant harsh competing kettle bells, or
spoiled harvests, poor fishings, hungry hours.&nbsp; It was good
for her, and it is the making of my story, that she came not
then, but with the pure white cheerful snow, to ring the burgh
bell in her childish escapade, and usher in with merriment the
New Year, and begin her new life happily in the old world.</p>
<p>She woke at noon among the scented curtains, in linen
sea-breeze bleached, under the camceil roof <a
name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>that all
children love, for it makes a garret like the ancestral cave, and
in rainy weather they can hear the pattering feet of foes above
them.&nbsp; She heard the sound of John Taggart&rsquo;s drum, and
the fifing of &ldquo;Happy we&rsquo;ve been a&rsquo;
thegether,&rdquo; and turning, found upon her pillow a sleeping
doll that woke whenever she raised it up, and stared at her in
wonderment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&mdash;Oh!&mdash;Oh! you roly-poley blonde!&rdquo;
cried the child in ecstasy, hugging it to her bosom and covering
it with kisses.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m as glad as anything.&nbsp;
Do you see the lovely little room?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll tell you
right here what your name is: it&rsquo;s Alison; no, it&rsquo;s
Bell; no, it&rsquo;s Alibel for your two just lovely, lovely
aunties.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Up she rose, sleep banished, with a sense of cheerfulness and
expectation, nimbly dressed herself, and slid down the banisters
to tumble plump at the feet of her Auntie Bell in the lobby.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mercy on us!&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll break your neck; are
you hurt?&rdquo; cried Aunt Bell.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not
kicking,&rdquo; said the child, and the dog waved furiously a
gladsome tail.&nbsp; A log fire blazed and crackled and hissed in
the parlour, and Mr Dyce tapped time with his fingers on a
chair-back to an internal hymn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My! ain&rsquo;t I the naughty girl to be snoozling away
like a gopher in a hole all day?&nbsp; Your clock&rsquo;s
stopped, Uncle Dan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr Dyce looked very guilty, and coughed, rubbing his
chin.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a noticing creature,&rdquo; said
he.&nbsp; &ldquo;I declare it <i>has</i> stopped.&nbsp; Well,
well!&rdquo; and his sister Bell plainly enjoyed some amusing
secret.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your uncle is always a little daft, my dear,&rdquo; she
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would rather be daft than dismal,&rdquo; he retorted,
cleaning his glasses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a singular thing that the clocks in our
lobby and parlour always stop on the New Year&rsquo;s day,
Lennox.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bud; please, say Bud,&rdquo; pleaded the little
one.&nbsp; <a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
37</span>&ldquo;Nobody ever calls me Lennox &rsquo;cept when
I&rsquo;m doing something wrong and almost going to get a
whipping.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, Bud, then.&nbsp; This clock gets something
wrong with it every New Year&rsquo;s day, for your uncle, that
man there, wants the folk who call never to know the time so that
they&rsquo;ll bide the longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tuts!&rdquo; said Uncle Dan, who had thought this was
his own particular recipe for joviality, and that they had never
discovered it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have come to a hospitable town, Bud,&rdquo; said
Ailie.&nbsp; &ldquo;There are convivial old gentlemen on the
other side of the street who have got up a petition to the
magistrates to shut up the inn and the public-house in the
afternoon.&nbsp; They say it is in the interests of temperance,
but it&rsquo;s really to compel their convivial friends to visit
themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I signed it myself,&rdquo; confessed Mr Dyce,
&ldquo;and I&rsquo;m only half convivial.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not
bragging; I might have been more convivial if it didn&rsquo;t so
easily give me a sore head.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s more cheerful than
a crowd in the house and the clash going?&nbsp; A fine fire, a
good light, and turn about at a story!&nbsp; The happiest time I
ever had in my life was when I broke my leg; so many folk called,
it was like a month of New Year&rsquo;s days.&nbsp; I was born
with a craving for company.&nbsp; Mother used to have a
superstition that if a knife or spoon dropped on the floor from
the table it betokened a visitor, and I used to drop them by the
dozen.&nbsp; But, dear me! here&rsquo;s a wean with a doll, and
where in the world did she get it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bud, with the doll under one arm and the dog tucked under the
other, laughed up in his face with shy perception.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you funny man!&rdquo; she exclaimed.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
guess you know all right who put Alibel on my pillow.&nbsp; Why!
I could have told you were a doll man: I noticed you turning over
the pennies in your pants&rsquo; pocket, same as poppa used when
he saw any nice clean little girl like me, and he was the
dolliest man <a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
38</span>in all Chicago.&nbsp; Why, there was treasury days when
he just rained dolls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was William, sure enough,&rdquo; said Mr
Dyce.&nbsp; &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no need for showing us your
strawberry mark.&nbsp; It was certainly William.&nbsp; If it had
only been dolls!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her name&rsquo;s Alibel, for her two aunties,&rdquo;
said the child.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tuts!&rdquo; said Mr Dyce.&nbsp; &ldquo;If I had
thought you meant to honour them that way I would have made her
twins.&nbsp; But you see I did not know; it was a delicate
transaction as it was.&nbsp; I could not tell very well whether a
doll or a&mdash;a&mdash;or a fountain pen would be the most
appropriate present for a ten-year-old niece from Chicago, and I
risked the doll.&nbsp; I hope it fits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like a halo.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s just sweet!&rdquo; said
the ecstatic maiden, and rescued one of its limbs from the gorge
of Footles.</p>
<p>It got about the town that to Dyces&rsquo; house had come a
wonderful American child who talked language like a minister: the
news was partly the news of the mail-driver and Wully Oliver, but
mostly the news of Kate, who, from the moment Lennox had been
taken from her presence and put to bed, had dwelt upon the
window-sashes, letting no one pass that side of the street
without her confidence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You never heard the like!&nbsp; No&rsquo; the size of a
shillin&rsquo;s worth of ha&rsquo;pennies, and she came all the
way by her lee-lone in the coach from
Chickagoo,&mdash;that&rsquo;s in America.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s to
be throng times in this house now, I&rsquo;m tellin&rsquo; you,
with brother William&rsquo;s wean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the forenoon advanced Kate&rsquo;s intelligence grew more
surprising: to the new-comer were ascribed a score of
characteristics such as had never been seen in the town
before.&nbsp; For one thing (would Kate assure them), she could
imitate Wully Oliver till you almost saw whiskers on her and
could smell the dram.&nbsp; She was thought to be a boy to start
<a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>with, but
that was only their ignorance in Chickagoo, for the girl was
really a lassie, and had kists of lassie&rsquo;s clothes coming
with the coach.</p>
<p>The Dyces&rsquo; foreigner was such a grand sensation that it
marred the splendour of the afternoon band parade, though John
Taggart was unusually glorious, walking on the very backs of his
heels, his nose in the heavens, and his drumsticks soaring and
circling over his head in a way to make the spectators
giddy.&nbsp; Instead of following the band till its
<i>r&eacute;pertoire</i> was suddenly done at five minutes to
twelve at the door of Maggie White, the wine and spirit merchant,
there were many that hung about the street in the hope of seeing
the American.&nbsp; They thought they would know her at once by
the colour of her skin, which some said would be yellow, and
others maintained would be brown.&nbsp; A few less patient and
more privileged boldly visited the house of Dyce to make their
New Year compliments and see the wonder for themselves.</p>
<p>The American had her eye on them.</p>
<p>She had her eye on the Sheriff&rsquo;s lady, who was so
determinedly affable, so pleased with everything the family of
Dyce might say, do, or possess, and only five times ventured to
indicate there were others, by a mention of &ldquo;the dear Lady
Anne&mdash;so nice, so simple, so unaffected, so
amiable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On Miss Minto of the crimson cloak, who kept her deaf ear to
the sisters and her good one to their brother, and laughed
heartily at all his little jokes even before they were half made,
or looked at him with large, soft, melting eyes and her lips
apart, which her glass had told her was an aspect
ravishing.&nbsp; The sisters smiled at each other when she had
gone and looked comically at Dan, but he, poor man, saw nothing
but just that Mary Minto was a good deal fatter than she used to
be.</p>
<p>On the doctor&rsquo;s two sisters, late come from a farm in
the country, marvellously at ease so long as the conversation
abode in gossip about the neighbours, <a name="page40"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 40</span>but in a silent terror when it rose
from persons to ideas, as it once had done when Lady Anne had
asked them what they thought of didactic poetry, and one of them
said it was a thing she was very fond of, and then fell in a
swound.</p>
<p>On the banker man, the teller, who was in hopeless love with
Ailie, as was plain from the way he devoted himself to Bell.</p>
<p>On Mr Dyce&rsquo;s old retired partner, Mr Cleland, who smelt
of cloves and did not care for tea.</p>
<p>On P. &amp; A. MacGlashan, who had come in specially to see if
the stranger knew his brother Albert, who, he said, was &ldquo;in
a Somewhere-ville in Manitoba.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the Provost and his lady, who were very old, and petted
each other when they thought themselves unobserved.</p>
<p>On the soft, kind, simple, content and happy ladies lately
married.</p>
<p>On the others who would like to be.</p>
<p>Yes, Bud had her eye on them all.&nbsp; They never guessed how
much they entertained her as they genteelly sipped their tea, or
wine, or ginger cordial,&mdash;the women of them,&mdash;or
coughed a little too artificially over the New Year
glass,&mdash;the men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wee Pawkie, that&rsquo;s what she is&mdash;just Wee
Pawkie!&rdquo; said the Provost when he got out, and so far it
summed up everything.</p>
<p>The ladies could not tear away home fast enough to see if they
had not a remnant of cloth that could be made into such a lovely
dress as that of Dyce&rsquo;s niece for one of their own
children.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mark my words!&rdquo; they said
&mdash;&ldquo;that child will be ruined between them.&nbsp;
She&rsquo;s her father&rsquo;s image, and he went and married a
poor play-actress, and stayed a dozen years away from Scotland,
and never wrote home a line.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So many people came to the house, plainly for no reason but to
see the new-comer, that Ailie at last made up her mind to satisfy
all by taking her out for a walk.&nbsp; The strange thing was
that in the <a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
41</span>street the populace displayed indifference or
blindness.&nbsp; Bud might have seen no more sign of interest in
her than the hurried glance of a passer-by; no step slowed to
show that the most was being made of the opportunity.&nbsp; There
had been some women at their windows when she came out of the
house sturdily walking by Aunt Ailie&rsquo;s side, with her hands
in her muff, and her keen black eyes peeping from under the fur
of her hood; but these women drew in their heads
immediately.&nbsp; Ailie, who knew her native town, was conscious
that from behind the curtains the scrutiny was keen.&nbsp; She
smiled to herself as she walked demurely down the street.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you feel anything, Bud?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>Bud naturally failed to comprehend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ought to feel something at your back; I&rsquo;m
ticklish all down the back because of a hundred eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; said the astounding child.&nbsp;
&ldquo;They think we don&rsquo;t notice, but I guess God sees
them,&rdquo; and yet she had apparently never glanced at the
windows herself, nor looked round to discover passers-by staring
over their shoulders at her aunt and her.</p>
<p>For a moment Ailie felt afraid.&nbsp; She dearly loved a quick
perception, but it was a gift, she felt, a niece might have too
young.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How in the world did you know that, Bud?&rdquo; she
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I just guessed they&rsquo;d be doing it,&rdquo; said
Bud, &ldquo;&rsquo;cause it&rsquo;s what I would do if I saw a
little girl from Scotland walking down the lake front in
Chicago.&nbsp; Is it dre&rsquo;ffle rude, Aunt Ailie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So they say, so they say,&rdquo; said her aunt, looking
straight forward, with her shoulders back and her eyes level,
flushing at the temples.&nbsp; &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m afraid we
can&rsquo;t help it.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s undignified&mdash;to be
seen doing it.&nbsp; I can see you&rsquo;re a real Dyce,
Bud.&nbsp; The other people who are not Dyces lose a great deal
of fun.&nbsp; Do you know, child, I think you and I are going to
be great friends&mdash;you and I and Aunt Bell and Uncle
Dan.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
42</span>&ldquo;And the Mosaic dog,&rdquo; added Bud with
warmth.&nbsp; &ldquo;I love that old dog so much that I
could&mdash;I could eat him.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s the becomingest
dog!&nbsp; Why, here he is!&rdquo;&nbsp; And it was indeed
Footles who hurled himself at them, a rapturous mass of unkempt
hair and convulsive barkings, having escaped from the
imprisonment of Kate&rsquo;s kitchen by climbing over her
shoulders and out across the window-sash.</p>
<h2><a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
43</span>CHAPTER VI.</h2>
<p>&ldquo;I <span class="smcap">heard</span> all about you and
Auntie Bell and Uncle Dan from pop&mdash;from father,&rdquo; said
Bud, as they walked back to the house.&nbsp; She had learned
already from example how sweeter sounded &ldquo;father&rdquo;
than the term she had used in America.&nbsp; &ldquo;He was mighty
apt to sit up nights talking about you all.&nbsp; But I
don&rsquo;t quite place Kate: he never mentioned Kate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, she&rsquo;s a new addition,&rdquo; explained
Ailie.&nbsp; &ldquo;Kate is the maid, you know: she came to us
long after your father left home, but she&rsquo;s been with us
five years now, and that&rsquo;s long enough to make her one of
the family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My!&nbsp; Five years!&nbsp; She ain&rsquo;t&mdash;she
isn&rsquo;t much of a quitter, is she?&nbsp; I guess you must
have tacked her down,&rdquo; said Bud.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
don&rsquo;t get helps in Chicago to linger round the dear old
spot like that; they get all hot running from base to base, same
as if it was a game of ball.&nbsp; But she&rsquo;s a
pretty&mdash;pretty broad girl, isn&rsquo;t she?&nbsp; She
couldn&rsquo;t run very fast; that&rsquo;ll be the way she
stays.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ailie smiled.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah!&nbsp; So that&rsquo;s Chicago,
too, is it?&nbsp; You must have been in the parlour a good many
times at five-o&rsquo;clock tea to have grasped the situation at
your age.&nbsp; I suppose your Chicago ladies lower the
temperature of their tea weeping into it the woes they have about
their domestics?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s another Anglo-Saxon
link.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs Jim said sensible girls that would stay long enough
to cool down after the last dash were getting <a
name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>that scarce
you had to go out after them with a gun.&nbsp; You didn&rsquo;t
really, you know; that was just Mrs Jim&rsquo;s way of putting
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; said Alison, unable to hide her
amusement.&nbsp; &ldquo;You seem to have picked up that way of
putting it yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Am I speaking slang?&rdquo; asked the child, glancing
up quickly and reddening.&nbsp; &ldquo;Father pro&mdash;prosisted
I wasn&rsquo;t to speak slang nor chew gum; he said it was things
no real lady would do in the old country, and that I was to be a
well-off English undefied.&nbsp; You must be dre&rsquo;ffle
shocked, Auntie Ailie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no,&rdquo; said Ailie cheerfully; &ldquo;I never was
shocked in all my life, though they say I&rsquo;m a shocker
myself.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m only surprised a little at the
possibilities of the English language.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve hardly
heard you use a word of slang yet, and still you scarcely speak a
sentence in which there&rsquo;s not some novelty.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s like Kate&rsquo;s first attempt at sheep&rsquo;s-head
broth: we were familiar with all the ingredients except the
horns, and we knew them elsewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right, then,&rdquo; said Bud,
relieved.&nbsp; &ldquo;But Mrs Jim had funny ways of putting
things, and I s&rsquo;pose I picked them up.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t
help it&mdash;I pick up so fast.&nbsp; Why, I had scarletina
twice! and I picked up her way of zaggerating: often I zaggerate
dre&rsquo;ffle, and say I wrote all the works of Shakespeare,
when I really didn&rsquo;t, you know.&nbsp; Mrs Jim didn&rsquo;t
mean that she had to go out hunting for helps with a gun; all she
meant was that they were getting harder and harder to get, and
mighty hard to keep when you got them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; said Alison.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an
old British story; you&rsquo;ll hear it often from our visitors,
if you&rsquo;re spared.&nbsp; But we&rsquo;re lucky with our
Kate; we seem to give her complete satisfaction, or, at all
events, she puts up with us.&nbsp; When she feels she can&rsquo;t
put up with us any longer, she hurls herself on the morning
newspaper to look at the advertisements for ladies&rsquo; maids
and housekeepers with &pound;50 a-year, and makes <a
name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>up her mind
to apply at once, but can never find a pen that suits her before
we make her laugh.&nbsp; The servant in the house of Dyce who
laughs is lost.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll like Kate, Bud.&nbsp; We like
her; and I notice that if you like anybody they generally like
you back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad,&rdquo; said Bud with
enthusiasm.&nbsp; &ldquo;If there&rsquo;s one thing under the
canopy I am, I&rsquo;m a liker.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had reached the door of the house without seeing the
slightest sign that the burgh was interested in them, but they
were no sooner in than a hundred tongues were discussing the
appearance of the little American.&nbsp; Ailie took off
Bud&rsquo;s cloak and hood, and pushed her into the kitchen, with
a whisper to her that she was to make Kate&rsquo;s acquaintance,
and be sure and praise her scones, then left her and flew
upstairs, with a pleasant sense of personal good-luck.&nbsp; It
was so sweet to know that brother William&rsquo;s child was
anything but a diffy.</p>
<p>Bud stood for a moment in the kitchen, bashful, for it must
not be supposed she lacked a childish shyness.&nbsp; Kate,
toasting bread at the fire, turned round and felt a little blate
herself, but smiled at her, such a fine expansive smile, it was
bound to put the child at ease.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come away in, my
dear, and take a bite,&rdquo; said the maid.&nbsp; It is so they
greet you&mdash;simple folk!&mdash;in the isle of Colonsay.</p>
<p>The night was coming on, once more with snowy feathers.&nbsp;
Wanton Wully lit the town.&nbsp; He went from lamp to lamp with a
ladder, children in his train chanting</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Leerie, leerie, light the lamps,<br />
Long legs and crooked shanks!&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>and he expostulating with &ldquo;I know you fine, the whole of
you; at least I know the boys.&nbsp; Stop you till I see your
mothers!&rdquo;&nbsp; Miss Minto&rsquo;s shop was open, and
shamefaced lads went dubiously in to buy ladies&rsquo; white
gloves, for with gloves they tryst their partners here at New
Year balls, and to-night was <a name="page46"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 46</span>Samson&rsquo;s fiddle giggling at the
inn.&nbsp; The long tenement lands, as flat and high as cliffs,
and built for all eternity, at first dark grey in the dusk, began
to glow in every window, and down the stairs and from the closes
flowed exceeding cheerful sounds.&nbsp; Green fires of wood and
coal sent up a cloud above these dwellings, tea-kettles jigged,
and sang.&nbsp; A thousand things were happening in the street,
but for once the maid of Colonsay restrained her interest in the
window.&nbsp; &ldquo;Tell me this, what did you say your name
was?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Miss Lennox Brenton Dyce,&rdquo; said Bud
primly, &ldquo;but the Miss don&rsquo;t amount to much till
I&rsquo;m old enough to get my hair up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must be tired coming so far.&nbsp; All the way from
that Chickagoo!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chicago,&rdquo; suggested Bud politely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just that!&nbsp; Chickagoo or Chicago, it depends on
the way you spell it,&rdquo; said Kate readily.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
was brought up to call it Chickagoo.&nbsp; What a length to come
on New Year&rsquo;s day!&nbsp; Were you not frightened?&nbsp; Try
one of them brown biscuits.&nbsp; And how are they all keeping in
America?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She asked the question with such tender solicitude that Bud
saw no humour in it, and answered gravely&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty spry, thank you.&nbsp; Have you been
there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me!&rdquo; cried Kate, with her bosom heaving at the
very thought.&nbsp; Then her Highland vanity came to her
rescue.&nbsp; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I have not been
exactly what you might call altogether there, but I had a cousin
that started for Australia, and got the length of Paisley.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;ll be a big place America?&nbsp; Put butter on
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The United States of America are bounded on the east by
the Atlantic Ocean, on the west by the Pacific, on the south by
Mexico and the Gulf, and on the north by an imaginary line called
Canada.&nbsp; The State of New York alone is as large as
England,&rdquo; said Bud glibly, repeating a familiar lesson.</p>
<p><a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
47</span>&ldquo;What a size!&rdquo; cried Kate.&nbsp; &ldquo;Take
another of them brown biscuits.&nbsp; Scotland&rsquo;s not slack
neither for size; there&rsquo;s Glasgow and Oban, and Colonsay
and Stornoway.&nbsp; There&rsquo;ll not be hills in
America?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no hills, just mountains,&rdquo; said
Bud.&nbsp; &ldquo;The chief mountain ranges are the Rocky
Mountains and the Alleghanies.&nbsp; They&rsquo;re about the
biggest mountains in the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Talking about big things, look at the big pennyworth of
milk we get here,&rdquo; said Kate, producing a can: it was
almost the last ditch of her national pride.</p>
<p>The child looked gravely into the can, and then glanced
shrewdly at the maid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t a pennyworth,&rdquo; said she sharply,
&ldquo;it&rsquo;s twopence worth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My stars! how did you know that?&rdquo; said Kate, much
taken aback.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Cause you&rsquo;re bragging.&nbsp; Think I
don&rsquo;t know when anybody&rsquo;s bragging?&rdquo; said
Bud.&nbsp; &ldquo;And when a body brags about a place or
anything, they zaggerate, and just about double
things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not canny,&rdquo; said Kate, thrusting the
milk-can back hastily on the kitchen dresser.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t spare the butter on your biscuit.&nbsp; They
tell me there&rsquo;s plenty of money in America.&nbsp; I would
not wonder, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, everybody&rsquo;s got money to throw at the birds
there,&rdquo; said Bud, with some of the accent as well as the
favourite phrase of Jim Molyneux.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have little to do; forbye, it&rsquo;s
cruelty.&nbsp; Mind you, there&rsquo;s plenty of money here too;
your uncle has a desperate lot of it.&nbsp; He was wanting to go
away to America and bring you home whenever he
heard&mdash;whenever he heard&mdash;&nbsp; Will you not try
another of them biscuits?&nbsp; It will do you no
harm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; said Bud gravely,&mdash;&ldquo;whenever
he heard about my father being dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we&rsquo;re sometimes very stupid, us from <a
name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
48</span>Colonsay,&rdquo; said the maid regretfully.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I should have kept my mouth shut about your father.&nbsp;
Take <i>two</i> biscuits, my dear; or maybe you would rather have
short-cake.&nbsp; Yes, he was for going there and then&mdash;even
if it cost a pound, I daresay,&mdash;but changed his mind when he
heard yon man Molyneux was bringing you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Footles, snug in the child&rsquo;s lap, shared the biscuits
and barked for more.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;I love little Footles,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His coat is so warm,<br />
And if I don&rsquo;t tease him<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He&rsquo;ll do me no harm,&rdquo;</p>
<p>said Bud, burying her head in his mane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good Lord! did you make that yourself, or just keep
mind of it?&rdquo; asked the astounded Kate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I made it just right here,&rdquo; said Bud
coolly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you know I could make
poetry?&nbsp; Why, you poor perishing soul, I&rsquo;m just a
regular wee&mdash;wee whitterick at poetry!&nbsp; It goes
sloshing round in my head, and it&rsquo;s simply pie for me to
make it.&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s another&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;Lives of great men oft remind us<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; We can make our lives sublime,<br />
And, departing, leave behind us<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Footprints on the sands of time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I just dash them off.&nbsp; I guess I&rsquo;ll have to get up
bright and early to-morrow and touch that one up some.&nbsp;
Mostly you can&rsquo;t make them good the first try, and then
you&rsquo;re bound to go all over them from the beginning and put
the good in here and there.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s art, Jim
says.&nbsp; He knew an artist who&rsquo;d finish a picture with
everything quite plain about it, and then say, &lsquo;Now for the
Art!&rsquo; and fuzz it all with a hard brush.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My stars! what things you know!&rdquo; exclaimed the
maid.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;re clever&mdash;tremendous
clever!&nbsp; What&rsquo;s your age?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
49</span>&ldquo;I was born mighty well near ten years ago,&rdquo;
said Bud, as if she were a centenarian.</p>
<p>Now it is not wise to tell a child like Lennox Dyce that she
is clever, though a maid from Colonsay could scarcely be expected
to know that.&nbsp; Till Bud had landed on the British shore she
had no reason to think herself anything out of the
ordinary.&nbsp; Jim Molyneux and his wife, with no children of
their own, and no knowledge of children except the elderly kind
that play in theatres, had treated her like a person little
younger than themselves, and saw no marvel in her quickness, that
is common enough with Young America.&nbsp; But Bud, from
Maryfield to her uncle&rsquo;s door, had been a
&ldquo;caution&rdquo; to the plainly admiring mail-driver; a kind
of fairy princess to Wanton Wully Oliver and his wife; the
surprise of her aunts had been only half concealed, and here was
the maid in an undisguised enchantment!&nbsp; The vanity of
ten-year-old was stimulated; for the first time in her life she
felt decidedly superior.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was very brave of me to come all this way in a ship
at ten years old,&rdquo; she proceeded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I once came to Oban along with a steamer myself,&rdquo;
said Kate, &ldquo;but och, that&rsquo;s nothing, for I knew a lot
of the drovers.&nbsp; Just fancy you coming from America!&nbsp;
Were you not lonely?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was dre&rsquo;ffle lonely,&rdquo; said Bud, who, in
fact, had never known a moment&rsquo;s dullness across the whole
Atlantic.&nbsp; &ldquo;There was I leaving my native land,
perhaps never to set eyes on its shores evermore, and coming to a
far country I didn&rsquo;t know the least thing about.&nbsp; I
was leaving all my dear young friends, and the beautiful Mrs
Molyneux, and her faithful dog Dodo, and&mdash;&rdquo; here she
squeezed a tear from her eyes, and stopped to think of
circumstances even more touching.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My poor wee hen!&rdquo; cried Kate, distressed.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you greet, and I&rsquo;ll buy you
something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I didn&rsquo;t know what sort of uncle and aunties
they might be here,&mdash;whether they&rsquo;d be cruel and <a
name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>wicked or
not, or whether they&rsquo;d keep me or not.&nbsp; Little girls
most always have cruel uncles and aunties&mdash;you can see that
in the books.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were awful stupid about that bit of it,&rdquo; said
the maid emphatically.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure anybody could
have told you about Mr Dyce and his sisters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then it was so stormy,&rdquo; proceeded Bud
quickly, in search of more moving considerations.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
made a poem about that too,&mdash;I just dashed it off; the first
verse goes&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;The breaking waves dashed high<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; On a stern and rock-bound coast&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>but I forget the rest, &rsquo;cept that</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;&mdash;they come to wither there<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Away from their childhood&rsquo;s land.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The waves were mountains high, and whirled over the deck,
and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My goodness, you would get all wet!&rdquo; said Kate,
putting her hand on Bud&rsquo;s shoulder to feel if she were dry
yet.&nbsp; Honest tears were in her own eyes at the thought of
such distressing affairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ship at last struck on a rock,&rdquo; proceeded
Bud, &ldquo;so the captain lashed me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would lash him, the villain!&rdquo; cried the
indignant maid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean that; he tied me&mdash;that&rsquo;s
lash in books&mdash;to the mast, and then&mdash;and
then&mdash;well, then we waited calmly for the end,&rdquo; said
Bud, at the last of her resources for ocean tragedy.</p>
<p>Kate&rsquo;s tears were streaming down her cheeks, at this
conjured vision of youth in dire distress.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh dear!
oh dear! my poor wee hen!&rdquo; she sobbed.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bud! coo-ie! coo-ie!&rdquo; came the voice of Aunt
Ailie along the lobby, but Bud was so entranced with the effect
of her imaginings that she paid no heed, and Kate&rsquo;s head
was wrapped in her apron.</p>
<p><a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
51</span>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t cry, Kate; I wouldn&rsquo;t cry if I
was you,&rdquo; said the child at last, soothingly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Maybe it&rsquo;s not true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll greet if I like,&rdquo; insisted the
maid.&nbsp; &ldquo;Fancy you in that awful shipwreck!&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s enough to scare anybody from going anywhere.&nbsp; Oh
dear! oh dear!&rdquo; and she wept more copiously than ever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t cry,&rdquo; said Bud again.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s silly to drizzle like that.&nbsp; Why, great
Queen of Sheba!&nbsp; I was only joshing you: it was as calm on
that ship as a milk sociable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate drew down the apron from her face and stared at
her.&nbsp; Her meaning was only half plain, but it was a relief
to know that things had not been quite so bad as she first
depicted them.&nbsp; &ldquo;A body&rsquo;s the better of a bit
greet, whiles,&rdquo; she said philosophically, drying her
eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I say,&rdquo; agreed Bud.&nbsp;
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I told you all that.&nbsp; Do you know,
child, I think you and I are going to be great
friends.&rdquo;&nbsp; She said this with the very tone and manner
of Alison, whose words they were to herself, and turned round
hastily and embarrassed at a laugh behind her to find her Aunt
had heard herself thus early imitated.</p>

52</span>CHAPTER VII.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">If</span> Molyneux, the actor, was to
blame for sending this child of ten on her journey into Scotland
without convoy, how much worse was his offence that he sent no
hint of her character to the house of Dyce?&nbsp; She was like
the carpet-bag George Jordon found at the inn door one day
without a name on it, and saying &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing
like thrift in a family,&rdquo; took home immediately, to lament
over for a week because he had not the key to open it.&nbsp;
There should have been a key to Lennox Brenton Dyce, but
Molyneux, a man of post-cards and curt and cryptic epistles
generally, never thought of that, so that it took some days for
the folk she came among to pick the lock.&nbsp; There was fun in
the process, it cannot be denied, but that was because the Dyces
were the Dyces; had they been many another folk she might have
been a mystery for years, and in the long-run spoiled
completely.&nbsp; Her mother had been a thousand women in her
time,&mdash;heroines good and evil, fairies, princesses, paupers,
maidens, mothers, shy and bold, plain or beautiful, young or old,
as the play of the week demanded,&mdash;a play-actress, in a
word.&nbsp; And now she was dead and buried, the bright white
lights on her no more, the music and the cheering done.&nbsp; But
not all dead and buried, for some of her was in her child.</p>
<p>Bud was born a mimic.&nbsp; I tell you this at once, because
so many inconsistencies will be found in her I should otherwise
look foolish to present her portrait for a piece of veritable
life.&nbsp; Not a mimic of voice and manner only, but a mimic of
people&rsquo;s minds, so <a name="page53"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 53</span>that for long&mdash;until the climax
came that was to change her when she found herself&mdash;she was
the echo and reflection of the last person she spoke with.&nbsp;
She borrowed minds and gestures as later she borrowed Grandma
Buntain&rsquo;s pelerine and bonnet.&nbsp; She could be all men
and all women except the plainly dull or wicked,&mdash;but only
on each occasion for a little while; by-and-by she was herself
again.</p>
<p>And so it was that for a day or two she played with the phrase
and accent of Wanton Wully Oliver, or startled her aunts with an
unconscious rendering of Kate&rsquo;s Highland accent, her
&ldquo;My stars!&rdquo; and &ldquo;Mercy me&rsquo;s!&rdquo; and
&ldquo;My wee hens!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The daft days (as we call New Year time) passed&mdash;the days
of careless merriment, that were but the start of Bud&rsquo;s
daft days, that last with all of us for years if we are
lucky.&nbsp; The town was settling down; the schools were opening
on Han&rsquo;sel Monday, and Bud was going&mdash;not to the
Grammar School after all, but to the Pigeons&rsquo;
Seminary.&nbsp; Have patience, and by-and-by I will tell about
the Pigeons.</p>
<p>Bell had been appalled to find the child, at the age of ten,
apparently incredibly neglected in her education.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course you would be at some sort of school yonder in
America?&rdquo; she had said at an early opportunity, not hoping
for much, but ready to learn of some hedgerow academy in spite of
all the papers said of Yales and Harvards and the like.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I never was at school; I was just going when father
died,&rdquo; said Bud, sitting on a sofa, wrapt in a cloak of
Ailie&rsquo;s, feeling extremely tall and beautiful and old.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&nbsp; Do you sit there and tell me they did not
send you to school?&rdquo; cried her aunt, so stunned that the
child delighted in her power to startle and amaze.&nbsp;
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s America for you!&nbsp; Ten years old, and not
the length of your alphabets,&mdash;it&rsquo;s what one might
expect from a heathen land of niggers, and lynchers, and
presidents.&nbsp; I was the best sewer and speller in Miss
Mushet&rsquo;s long before I was ten.&nbsp; My <a
name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 54</span>lassie, let
me tell you you have come to a country where you&rsquo;ll get
your education!&nbsp; We would make you take it at its best if we
had to live on meal.&nbsp; Look at your Auntie Ailie&mdash;French
and German, and a hand like copperplate; it&rsquo;s a treat to
see her at the old scrutoire, no way put about, composing.&nbsp;
Just goes at it like lightning!&nbsp; I do declare if your Uncle
Dan was done, Ailie could carry on the business, all except the
aliments and sequestrations.&nbsp; It beats all!&nbsp; Ten years
old and not to know the A B C!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but I do,&rdquo; said Bud quickly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
learned the alphabet off the play-bills,&mdash;the big G&rsquo;s
first, because there&rsquo;s so many Greats and Grands and
Gorgeouses in them.&nbsp; And then Mrs Molyneux used to let me
try to read Jim&rsquo;s press notices.&nbsp; She read them first
every morning sitting up in bed at breakfast, and said,
&lsquo;My! wasn&rsquo;t he a great man?&rsquo; and then
she&rsquo;d cry a little, &rsquo;cause he never got justice from
the managers, for they were all mean and jealous of him.&nbsp;
Then she&rsquo;d spray herself with the Peau d&rsquo;espagne and
eat a cracker.&nbsp; And the best papers there was in the land
said the part of the butler in the second act was well filled by
Mister Jim Molyneux; or among others in a fine cast were J.
Molyneux, Ralph Devereux, and O. G. Tarpoll.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re talking about, my
poor wee whitterick; but it&rsquo;s all haivers,&rdquo; said Miss
Bell.&nbsp; &ldquo;Can you spell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the words are not too big, or silly ones where
it&rsquo;s &lsquo;ei&rsquo; or &lsquo;ie,&rsquo; and you have to
guess,&rdquo; said Bud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spell cat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bud stared at her incredulously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spell cat,&rdquo; repeated her aunt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;K-a-t-t,&rdquo; said Bud (oh, naughty Bud!).</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mercy!&rdquo; cried Bell with horrified hands in the
air.&nbsp; &ldquo;Off you pack to-morrow to the Seminary.&nbsp; I
wouldn&rsquo;t wonder if you did not know a single word of the
Shorter Catechism.&nbsp; Perhaps they have not such a thing in
that awful heathen land you came from?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>Bud
could honestly say she had never heard of the Shorter
Catechism.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My poor neglected bairn,&rdquo; said her aunt
piteously, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re sitting there in the dark with no
conviction of sin, and nothing bothering you, and you might be
dead to-morrow!&nbsp; Mind this, that &lsquo;Man&rsquo;s chief
end is to glorify God, and to enjoy Him for ever.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Say that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Man&rsquo;s chief end is to glorify God, and to enjoy
Him for ever,&rdquo; repeated Bud obediently, rolling her
r&rsquo;s and looking solemn like her aunt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you ever hear of Robert Bruce, him that watched the
spiders?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here, too, the naughty Bud protested ignorance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was the saviour of his country,&rdquo; said
Bell.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mind that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Auntie, I thought it was George Washington,&rdquo;
said Bud, surprised.&nbsp; &ldquo;I guess if you&rsquo;re looking
for a little wee stupid, it&rsquo;s me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re talking about Scotland,&rdquo; said Miss
Bell severely.&nbsp; &ldquo;He saved Scotland.&nbsp; It was well
worth while!&nbsp; Can you do your sums?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can <i>not</i>,&rdquo; said Bud emphatically.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I hate them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Bell said not a word more; she was too distressed at such
confessed benightedness; but she went out of the parlour to
search for Ailie.&nbsp; Bud forgot she was beautiful and tall and
old in Ailie&rsquo;s cloak; she was repeating to herself
Man&rsquo;s Chief End with rolling r&rsquo;s, and firmly fixing
in her memory the fact that Robert Bruce, not George Washington,
was the saviour of his country and watched spiders.</p>
<p>Ailie was out, and so her sister found no ear for her
bewailings over the child&rsquo;s neglected education till Mr
Dyce came in humming the tune of the day&mdash;&ldquo;Sweet
Afton&rdquo;&mdash;to change his hat for one more becoming to a
sitting of the Sheriff Court.&nbsp; He was searching for his good
one in what he was used to call &ldquo;the piety press,&rdquo;
for there was hung his Sunday clothes, when Bell distressfully
informed him that the child could not so much as spell cat.</p>
<p><a name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
56</span>&ldquo;Nonsense I don&rsquo;t believe it,&rdquo; said
he.&nbsp; &ldquo;That would be very unlike our
William.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s true,&mdash;I tried her myself!&rdquo; said
Bell.&nbsp; &ldquo;She was never at a school: isn&rsquo;t it just
deplorable?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m!&rdquo; said Mr Dyce, &ldquo;it depends on
the way you look at it, Bell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She does not know a word of her Catechism, nor the name
of Robert Bruce, and says she hates counting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hates counting!&rdquo; repeated Mr Dyce, wonderfully
cheering up, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s hopeful; it reminds me of
myself.&nbsp; Forbye its gey like brother William.&nbsp; His way
of counting was &lsquo;&pound;1.10. in my pocket, &pound;2 that
I&rsquo;m owing some one, and 10s. I get
to-morrow&mdash;that&rsquo;s &pound;5 I have; what will I buy you
now?&rsquo;&nbsp; The worst of arithmetic is that it leaves
nothing to the imagination.&nbsp; Two and two&rsquo;s four and
you&rsquo;re done with it; there&rsquo;s no scope for either fun
or fancy as there might be if the two and two went courting in
the dark and swapped their partners by an accident.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you would go in and speak to her,&rdquo; said
Bell, distressed still, &ldquo;and tell her what a lot she has to
learn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, me!&rdquo; cried Uncle Dan&mdash;&ldquo;excuse my
grammar,&rdquo; and he laughed.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s an
imprudent kind of mission for a man with all his knowledge in
little patches.&nbsp; I have a lot to learn, myself, Bell; it
takes me all my time to keep the folk I meet from finding out the
fact.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But he went in humming, Bell behind him, and found the child
still practising Man&rsquo;s Chief End, so engrossed in the
exercise she never heard him enter.&nbsp; He crept behind her,
and put his hands over her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess who,&rdquo; said he, in a shrill falsetto.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Robert Bruce,&rdquo; said Bud, without
moving.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&mdash;cold&mdash;cold!&mdash;guess again,&rdquo;
said her uncle, growling like Giant Blunderbore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll mention no names,&rdquo; said she,
&ldquo;but it&rsquo;s mighty like Uncle Dan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stood in front of her and put on a serious face,</p>
<p><a name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
57</span>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this I am hearing, Miss
Lennox,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;about a little girl who
doesn&rsquo;t know a lot of things nice little girls ought to
know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Man&rsquo;s chief end is to glorify God, and to enjoy
Him for ever,&rdquo; repeated Bud reflectively.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got that all right, but what does it
mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does it mean?&rdquo; said Mr Dyce, a bit taken
aback.&nbsp; &ldquo;You tell her, Bell; what does it mean?&nbsp;
I must not be late for the court.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re far cleverer than I am,&rdquo; said
Bell.&nbsp; &ldquo;Tell her yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It means,&rdquo; said Daniel Dyce the lawyer, seating
himself on the sofa beside his niece, &ldquo;that man in himself
is a gey poor soul, no&rsquo; worth a pin, though he&rsquo;s apt
to think the world was made for his personal satisfaction.&nbsp;
At the best he&rsquo;s but an instrument&mdash;a harp of a
thousand strings God bends to hear in His leisure.&nbsp; He made
that harp&mdash;the heart and mind of man&mdash;when He was in a
happy hour.&nbsp; Strings hale and strings broken, strings slack
or tight, there are all kinds of them; the best we can do&rsquo;s
to be taut and trembling for the gladness of God Who loves fine
music, and set the stars themselves to singing from the very day
He put them birling in the void.&nbsp; To glorify&rsquo;s to
wonder and adore, and who keeps the wondering humble heart, the
adoring eye, is to God pleasing exceedingly.&nbsp; Sing, lassie,
sing, sing, sing, inside ye, even if ye are as timmer as a
cask.&nbsp; God knows I have not much of a voice myself, but
I&rsquo;m full of nobler airs than ever crossed my rusty
thrapple.&nbsp; To be grateful always, and glad things are no
worse, is a good song to start the morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, but sin, Dan, sin!&rdquo; said Bell, sighing, for
she always feared her own light-heartedness.&nbsp; &ldquo;We may
be too joco.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say ye so?&rdquo; he cried, turning to his sister with
a flame upon his visage.&nbsp; &ldquo;By the heavens above us,
no!&nbsp; Sin might have been eternal; each abominable thought
might have kept in our minds, constant day and night from the
moment that it bred there; the <a name="page58"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 58</span>theft we did might keep everlastingly
our hand in our neighbour&rsquo;s kist as in a trap; the knife we
thrust with might have kept us thrusting for ever and for
ever.&nbsp; But no,&mdash;God&rsquo;s good! sleep comes, and the
clean morning, and the morning is Christ, and every moment of
time is a new opportunity to amend.&nbsp; It is not sin that is
eternal, it is righteousness, and peace.&nbsp; Joco!&nbsp; We
cannot be too joco, having our inheritance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stopped suddenly, warned by a glance of his sister&rsquo;s,
and turned to look in his niece&rsquo;s face to find bewilderment
there.&nbsp; The mood that was not often published by Dan Dyce
left him in a flash, and he laughed and put his arms round
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;re a lot wiser for my sermon,
Bud,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;I can see you have pins and needles
worse than under the Reverend Mr Frazer on the Front.&nbsp;
What&rsquo;s the American for haivers&mdash;for foolish
speeches?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hot air,&rdquo; said Bud promptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; said Dan Dyce, rubbing his hands
together.&nbsp; &ldquo;What I&rsquo;m saying may seem just hot
air to you, but it&rsquo;s meant.&nbsp; You do not know the
Shorter Catechism; never mind; there&rsquo;s a lot of it
I&rsquo;m afraid I do not know myself; but the whole of it is in
that first answer to Man&rsquo;s Chief End.&nbsp; Reading and
writing, and all the rest of it, are of less importance, but
I&rsquo;ll not deny they&rsquo;re gey and handy.&nbsp;
You&rsquo;re no Dyce if you don&rsquo;t master them easily
enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He kissed her and got gaily up and turned to go.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;for the law, seeing
we&rsquo;re done with the gospels.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m a conveyancing
lawyer&mdash;though you&rsquo;ll not know what that
means&mdash;so mind me in your prayers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bell went out into the lobby after him, leaving Bud in a
curious frame of mind, for Man&rsquo;s Chief End, and
Bruce&rsquo;s spider, and the word &ldquo;joco,&rdquo; all
tumbled about in her, demanding mastery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little help I got from you, Dan!&rdquo; said Bell to
her brother.&nbsp; &ldquo;You never even tried her with a
multiplication table.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
59</span>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s seven times nine?&rdquo; he asked
her, with his fingers on the handle of the outer door, his eyes
mockingly mischievous.</p>
<p>She flushed, and laughed, and pushed him on the
shoulder.&nbsp; &ldquo;Go away with you!&rdquo; said she.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Fine you ken I could never mind seven times!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No Dyce ever could,&rdquo; said
he,&mdash;&ldquo;excepting Ailie.&nbsp; Get her to put the little
creature through her tests.&nbsp; If she&rsquo;s not able to
spell cat at ten she&rsquo;ll be an astounding woman by the time
she&rsquo;s twenty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The end of it was that Aunt Ailie, whenever she came in, upon
Bell&rsquo;s report, went over the street to Rodger&rsquo;s shop
and made a purchase.&nbsp; As she hurried back with it,
bare-headed, in a cool drizzle of rain that jewelled her
wonderful hair, she felt like a child herself again.&nbsp; The
banker-man saw her from his lodging as she flew across the street
with sparkling eyes and eager lips, the roses on her cheeks, and
was sure, foolish man! that she had been for a new novel or maybe
a cosmetique, since in Rodger&rsquo;s shop they sell books and
balms and ointments.&nbsp; She made the quiet street magnificent
for a second&mdash;a poor wee second, and then, for him, the sun
went down.&nbsp; The tap of the knocker on the door she closed
behind her struck him on the heart.&nbsp; You may guess, good
women, if you like, that at the end of the book the banker-man is
to marry Ailie, but you&rsquo;ll be wrong; she was not thinking
of the man at all at all&mdash;she had more to do; she was
hurrying to open the gate of gold to her little niece.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve brought you something wonderful,&rdquo; said
she to the child&mdash;&ldquo;better than dolls, better than my
cloak, better than everything; guess what it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bud wrinkled her brows.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah, dear!&rdquo; she
sighed, &ldquo;we may be too joco!&nbsp; And I&rsquo;m to sing,
sing, sing even if I&rsquo;m as&mdash;timmer as a cask, and
Robert Bruce is the saviour of his country.&rdquo;&nbsp; She
marched across the room, trailing Ailie&rsquo;s cloak with her,
in an absurd caricature of Bell&rsquo;s brisk manner.&nbsp; Yet
not so much the actress engrossed in her performance, but what <a
name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>she tried to
get a glimpse of what her aunt concealed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You need not try to see it,&rdquo; said Ailie, smiling,
with the secret in her breast.&nbsp; &ldquo;You must honestly
guess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better&rsquo;n dolls and candies, oh, my!&rdquo; said
Bud; &ldquo;I hope it&rsquo;s not the Shorter Catechism,&rdquo;
she concluded, looking so grave that her aunt laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not the Catechism,&rdquo; said Ailie;
&ldquo;try again.&nbsp; Oh, but you&rsquo;ll never guess!&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s a key.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A key?&rdquo; repeated Bud, plainly cast down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A gold key,&rdquo; said her aunt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What for?&rdquo; asked Bud.</p>
<p>Ailie sat herself down on the floor and drew the child upon
her knees.&nbsp; She had a way of doing that which made her look
like a lass in her teens; indeed, it was most pleasing if the
banker-man could just have seen it!&nbsp; &ldquo;A gold
key,&rdquo; she repeated, lovingly, in Bud&rsquo;s ear.&nbsp;
&ldquo;A key to a garden&mdash;the loveliest garden, with flowers
that last the whole year round.&nbsp; You can pluck and pluck at
them and they&rsquo;re never a single one the less.&nbsp; Better
than sweet peas!&nbsp; But that&rsquo;s not all, there&rsquo;s a
big garden-party to be at it&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My!&nbsp; I guess I&rsquo;ll put on my best glad
rags,&rdquo; said Bud.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>And</i> the hat with
pink.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then a fear came to her face.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Why, Aunt Ailie, you can&rsquo;t have a garden-party this
time of the year,&rdquo; and she looked at the window down whose
panes the rain was now streaming.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This garden-party goes on all the time,&rdquo; said
Ailie.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who cares about the weather?&nbsp; Only very
old people; not you and I.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll introduce you to a
lot of nice people&mdash;Di Vernon, and&mdash;you don&rsquo;t
happen to know a lady called Di Vernon, do you, Bud?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t know her if she was handed to me on a
plate with parsley trimmings,&rdquo; said Bud promptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&mdash;Di Vernon, then, and Effie Deans, and Little
Nell, and the Marchioness; and Richard Swiveller, and Tom Pinch,
and the Cranford folks, and Juliet Capulet&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
61</span>&ldquo;She must belong to one of the first
families,&rdquo; said Bud.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have a kind of idea
that I have heard of her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Mr Falstaff&mdash;such a naughty man, but nice
too!&nbsp; And Rosalind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rosalind!&rdquo; cried Bud.&nbsp; &ldquo;You mean
Rosalind in &lsquo;As You Like It&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ailie stared at her with astonishment.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
amazing child!&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;who told you about
&lsquo;As You Like It&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody told me; I just read about her when Jim was
learning the part of Charles the Wrestler he played on six
&rsquo;secutive nights in the Waldorf.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Read it!&rdquo; exclaimed her aunt.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
mean he or Mrs Molyneux read it to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I read it myself,&rdquo; said Bud.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;&lsquo;Now my co-mates and brothers in
exile,<br />
Hath not old custom made this life more sweet<br />
Than that of painted pomp?&nbsp; Are not these woods<br />
More free from peril than the envious Court?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She threw Aunt Ailie&rsquo;s cloak over one shoulder, put
forth a ridiculously little leg with an air of the playhouse, and
made the gestures of Jim Molyneux.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you couldn&rsquo;t read,&rdquo; said
Ailie.&nbsp; &ldquo;You little fraud!&nbsp; You made Aunt Bell
think you couldn&rsquo;t spell cat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Queen of Sheba! did she think I was in
earnest?&rdquo; cried Bud.&nbsp; &ldquo;I was just
pretending.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m apt to be pretending pretty often;
why, Kate thinks I make Works.&nbsp; I can read anything;
I&rsquo;ve read books that big it gave you cramp.&nbsp; I
s&rsquo;pose you were only making-believe about that garden, and
you haven&rsquo;t any key at all, but I don&rsquo;t mind;
I&rsquo;m not kicking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ailie put her hand to her bosom and revealed the Twopenny she
had bought to be the key to the wonderful garden of
letters&mdash;the slim little grey-paper-covered primer in which
she had learned her own first lessons.&nbsp; She held it up
between her finger <a name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
62</span>and thumb that Bud might read its title on the
cover.&nbsp; Bud understood immediately and laughed, but not
quite at her ease for once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m dre&rsquo;ffle sorry, Aunt Ailie,&rdquo; she
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;It was wicked to pretend just like that, and
put you to a lot of trouble.&nbsp; Father wouldn&rsquo;t have
liked that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m not kicking,&rdquo; said Ailie, borrowing
her phrase to put her at her ease again.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
too glad you&rsquo;re not so far behind as Aunt Bell
imagined.&nbsp; So you like books?&nbsp; Capital!&nbsp; And
Shakespeare no less!&nbsp; What do you like best, now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poetry,&rdquo; said Bud.&nbsp; &ldquo;Particularly the
bits I don&rsquo;t understand, but just about almost.&nbsp; I
can&rsquo;t bear to stop and dally with too easy poetry; once I
know it all plain and there&rsquo;s no more to it,
I&mdash;I&mdash;I love to amble on.&nbsp; I&mdash;why! I make
poetry myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; said Ailie with twinkling eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sort of poetry,&rdquo; said Bud.&nbsp; &ldquo;Not so
good as &lsquo;As You Like It&rsquo;&mdash;not <i>nearly</i> so
good, of course!&nbsp; I have loads of truly truly poetry inside
me, but it sticks at the bends, and then I get bits that fit,
made by somebody else, and wish I had been spry and said them
first.&nbsp; Other times I&rsquo;m the real Winifred
Wallace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Winifred Wallace?&rdquo; said Aunt Ailie
inquiringly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Winifred Wallace,&rdquo; repeated Bud composedly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m her.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s my&mdash;it&rsquo;s my
poetry name.&nbsp; &lsquo;Bud Dyce&rsquo; wouldn&rsquo;t be any
use for the magazines; it&rsquo;s not dinky enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bless me, child, you don&rsquo;t tell me you write
poetry for the magazines?&rdquo; said her astonished aunt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Bud, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ll be pretty
liable to when I&rsquo;m old enough to wear specs.&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s if I don&rsquo;t go on the stage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the stage!&rdquo; exclaimed Ailie, full of wild
alarm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the child, &ldquo;Mrs Molyneux said I
was a born actress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder, I wonder,&rdquo; said Aunt Ailie, staring
into vacancy.</p>

63</span>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Daniel Dyce</span> had an office up the
street at the windy corner facing the Cross, with two clerks in
it and a boy who docketed letters and ran errands.&nbsp; Once
upon a time there was a partner,&mdash;Cleland &amp; Dyce the
firm had been,&mdash;but Cleland was a shy and melancholy man
whose only hours of confidence and gaiety came to him after
injudicious drams.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas patent to all how his habits
seized him, but nobody mentioned it except in a whisper,
sometimes as a kind of little accident, for in everything else he
was the perfect gentleman, and here we never like to see the
honest gentry down.&nbsp; All men liked Colin Cleland, and many
would share his jovial hours who took their law business
elsewhere than to Cleland &amp; Dyce.&nbsp; That is the way of
the world, too; most men keep their jovial-money in a different
pocket from where they keep their cash.&nbsp; The time came when
it behoved Mr Cleland to retire.&nbsp; Men who knew the
circumstances said Dan Dyce paid rather dear for that retirement,
and indeed it might be so in the stricter way of commerce, but
the lawyer was a Christian who did not hang up his conscience in
the &ldquo;piety press&rdquo; with his Sunday clothes.&nbsp; He
gave his partner a good deal more than he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;ll come in sometimes and see me whiles
at night and join in a glass of toddy,&rdquo; said Mr
Cleland.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll certainly come and see you,&rdquo; said Dan
Dyce.&nbsp; And then he put his arm affectionately through that
of his old partner, and added, &ldquo;I would&mdash;I would
ca&rsquo; <a name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
64</span>canny wi&rsquo; the toddy, Colin,&rdquo; coating the
pill in sweet and kindly Scots.&nbsp; Thank God, we have two
tongues in our place, and can speak the bitter truth in terms
that show humility and love, and not the sense of righteousness,
dictate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh!&nbsp; What for?&rdquo; said Mr Cleland, his vanity
at once in arms.</p>
<p>Dan Dyce looked in his alarmed and wavering eyes a moment, and
thought, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use?&nbsp; He knows himself,
they always do!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For fear&mdash;for fear of fat,&rdquo; he said, with a
little laugh, tapping with his finger on his quondam
partner&rsquo;s widening waistcoat.&nbsp; &ldquo;There are signs
of a prominent profile, Colin.&nbsp; If you go on as you&rsquo;re
doing it will be a dreadful expense for watch-guards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Colin Cleland at once became the easy-osey man again, and
smiled.&nbsp; &ldquo;Fat, man! it&rsquo;s not fat,&rdquo; said
he, clapping himself on the waistcoat; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
information.&nbsp; Do you know, Dan, for a second, there, I
thought you meant to be unkind, and it would be devilish unlike
you to be unkind.&nbsp; I thought you meant something else.&nbsp;
The breath of vulgar suspicion has mentioned drink.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pity that!&rdquo; said Mr Dyce, &ldquo;for
a whole cask of cloves will not disguise the breath of
suspicion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was five years now since Colin Cleland retired among his
toddy rummers, and if this were a fancy story I would be telling
you how he fell, and fell, and fell; but the
truth&mdash;it&rsquo;s almost lamentable&mdash;is that the old
rogue throve on leisure and ambrosial nights with men who were
now quite ready to give the firm of Daniel Dyce their business,
seeing they had Colin Cleland all to themselves and under
observation.&nbsp; Trust estates and factorages from all quarters
of the county came now to the office at the windy corner.&nbsp; A
Christian lawyer with a sense of fun, unspotted by the world, and
yet with a name for winning causes, was what the shire had long
been wanting.&nbsp; And Daniel Dyce grew rich.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m making money so <a name="page65"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 65</span>fast,&rdquo; he said one day to his
sisters (it was before Bud came), &ldquo;that I wonder often what
poor souls are suffering for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Said Bell, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a burden that&rsquo;s easy put up
with.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll be able now to get a new pair of curtains
for the back bedroom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A pair of curtains!&rdquo; said her brother, with a
smile to Ailie.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ay, a score of pairs if
they&rsquo;re needed, even if the vogue was Valenciennes.&nbsp;
Your notion of wealth, Bell, is Old
Malabar&rsquo;s&mdash;&lsquo;Twopence more, and up goes the
cuddy!&rsquo;&nbsp; Woman, I&rsquo;m fair rolling in
wealth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said it with a kind of exultation that brought to her face
a look of fear and disapproval.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, Dan,
don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she cried&mdash;&ldquo;don&rsquo;t brag of
the world&rsquo;s dross; it&rsquo;s not like you.&nbsp; &lsquo;He
that hasteth to be rich, shall not be innocent,&rsquo; says the
Proverbs.&nbsp; You must be needing medicine.&nbsp; We should
have humble hearts.&nbsp; How many that were high have had a
fall!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you frightened God will hear me and rue His
bounty?&rdquo; said the brother in a whisper.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not bragging; I&rsquo;m just telling
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you&rsquo;re not hoarding it,&rdquo; proceeded
Miss Bell.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not
wise-like&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor Dyce-like either,&rdquo; said Miss Ailie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s many a poor body in the town this winter
that&rsquo;s needful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I daresay,&rdquo; said Daniel Dyce coldly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The poor we have always with us.&nbsp; The thing, they
tell me, is decreed by Providence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Providence is not aye looking,&rdquo; said
Bell.&nbsp; &ldquo;If that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re frightened
for, I&rsquo;ll be your almoner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s their own blame, you may be sure, if
they&rsquo;re poor.&nbsp; Improvidence and&mdash;and drink.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll warrant they have their glass of ale every
Saturday.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s ale?&nbsp; Is there any moral
elevation in it?&nbsp; Its nutritive quality, I believe, is less
than the tenth part of a penny bap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but the poor creatures!&rdquo; sighed Miss
Bell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Possibly,&rdquo; said Dan Dyce, &ldquo;but every man
must look after himself; and as you say, many a man well <a
name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 66</span>off has come
down in the world.&nbsp; We should take no risks.&nbsp; I had
Black the baker at me yesterday for &pound;20 in loan to tide
over some trouble with his flour merchant and pay an account to
Miss Minto.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A decent man, with a wife and seven children,&rdquo;
said Miss Bell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Decent or not, he&rsquo;ll not be coming back borrowing
from me in a hurry.&nbsp; I set him off with a flea in his
lug.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not needing curtains,&rdquo; said Miss Bell
hurriedly; &ldquo;the pair we have are fine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan finished his breakfast that day with a smile, flicked the
crumbs off his waistcoat, gave one uneasy glance at Ailie, and
went off to business humming &ldquo;There is a Happy
Land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear me, I&rsquo;m afraid he&rsquo;s growing a
perfect miser,&rdquo; moaned Bell when she heard the door close
behind him.&nbsp; &ldquo;He did not use to be like that when he
was younger and poorer.&nbsp; Money&rsquo;s like the toothache, a
commanding thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ailie smiled.&nbsp; &ldquo;If you went about as much as I do,
Bell,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you would not be misled by
Dan&rsquo;s pretences.&nbsp; And as for Black the baker, I saw
his wife in Miss Minto&rsquo;s yesterday buying boots for her
children and a bonnet for herself.&nbsp; She called me Miss
Ailie, an honour I never got from her in all my life
before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think&mdash;do you think he gave Black the
money?&rdquo; said Bell in a pleasant excitation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course he did.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s Dan&rsquo;s way to
give it to some folk with a pretence of reluctance, for if he did
not growl they would never be off his face!&nbsp; He&rsquo;s
telling us about the lecture that accompanied it as a solace to
our femininity.&nbsp; Women, you know, are very bad lenders, and
dislike the practice in their husbands and brothers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None of the women I know,&rdquo; protested Bell.&nbsp;
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re just as free-handed as the men if they had
it.&nbsp; I hope,&rdquo; she added anxiously, &ldquo;that Dan got
good security.&nbsp; Would it be a dear bonnet, now, that she was
getting?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 67</span>Ailie
laughed,&mdash;a ridiculous sort of sister this; she only
laughed.</p>
<p>Six times each lawful day Daniel Dyce went up and down the
street between his house and the office at the windy corner
opposite the Cross, the business day being divided by an interval
of four hours to suit the mails.&nbsp; The town folk liked to see
him passing; he gave the street an air of occupation and gaiety,
as if a trip had just come in with a brass band banging at the
latest air.&nbsp; Going or coming, he was apt to be humming a
tune to himself as he went along with his hands in his outside
pockets, and it was an unusual day when he did not stop to look
in at a shop window or two on the way, though they never changed
a feature once a-month.&nbsp; To the shops he honoured thus it
was almost as good as a big turnover.&nbsp; Before him his dog
went whirling and barking, a long alarm for the clerks to stop
their game of Catch-the-Ten and dip their pens.&nbsp; There were
few that passed him without some words of recognition.</p>
<p>He was coming down from the office on the afternoon of the
Han&rsquo;sel Monday that started Bud in the Pigeons&rsquo;
Seminary when he met the nurse, old Betty Baxter, with a
basket.&nbsp; She put it down at her feet, and bobbed a curtsey,
a thing that nowadays you rarely see in Scotland.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tuts! woman,&rdquo; he said to her, lifting the basket
and putting it in her hand.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why need you bother with
the like of that?&nbsp; You and your curtseys!&nbsp;
They&rsquo;re out of date, Miss Baxter, out of date, like the
decent men that deserved them long ago before my time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, they&rsquo;re not out of date, Mr Dyce,&rdquo; said
she; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll aye be minding you about my mother;
you&rsquo;ll be paid back some day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tuts!&rdquo; said he again, impatient.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re an awful blether: how&rsquo;s your patient,
Duncan Gill?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As dour as the devil, sir,&rdquo; said the nurse.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Still hanging on.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
68</span>&ldquo;Poor man! poor man!&rdquo; said Mr Dyce.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll just have to put his trust in God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;s no&rsquo; so far through as all
that,&rdquo; said Betty Baxter.&nbsp; &ldquo;He can still sit up
and take his drop of porridge.&nbsp; They&rsquo;re telling me you
have got a wonderful niece, Mr Dyce, all the way from
America.&nbsp; What a mercy for her!&nbsp; But I have not set
eyes on her yet.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m so busy that I could not stand
in the close like the others, watching: what is she
like?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just like Jean Macrae,&rdquo; said Mr Dyce, preparing
to move on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what was Jean Macrae like?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, just like other folk,&rdquo; said Mr Dyce, and
passed on chuckling, to run almost into the arms of Captain
Consequence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you heard the latest?&rdquo; said Captain
Consequence, putting his kid-gloved hand on the shoulder of the
lawyer, who felt it like a lump of ice, for he did not greatly
like the man, the smell of whose cigars, he said, before he knew
they came from the Pilgrim Widow&rsquo;s, proved that he rose
from the ranks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Captain Brodie,&rdquo; he said coldly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s the rogue or the fool this time?&rdquo; but
the Captain was too stupid to perceive it.&nbsp; He stared
perplexedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hear,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;the Doctor&rsquo;s in a
difficulty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he, is he?&rdquo; said Mr Dyce.&nbsp;
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a chance for his friends to stand by
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let him take it!&rdquo; said Captain Consequence,
puffing.&nbsp; &ldquo;Did he not say to me once yonder,
&lsquo;God knows how you&rsquo;re living.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be God alone, for all the rest of us are
wondering,&rdquo; said Mr Dyce, and left the man to put it in his
pipe and smoke it.</p>
<p>Along the street came the two Miss Duffs, who kept the dame
school, and he saw a hesitation in their manner when they
realised a meeting was inevitable.&nbsp; If they had been folk
that owed him anything he would not have wondered, from their
manner, to see them tuck up their skirts and scurry <a
name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 69</span>down the
lane.&nbsp; Twins they were&mdash;a tiny couple, scarcely young,
dressed always in a douce long-lasting brown, something in their
walk and colour that made them look like pigeon hens, and long
ago conferred on them that name in Daniel Dyce&rsquo;s
dwelling.&nbsp; They met him in front of his own door, and seemed
inclined to pass in a trepidation.</p>
<p>He took off his hat to them and stood, full of curiosity about
Lennox.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a lovely winter day!&rdquo; said Miss Jean, with
an air of supplication, as if her very life depended on his
agreement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it <i>perfectly</i> exquisite!&rdquo; said
Miss Amelia, who usually picked up the bald details of her
sister&rsquo;s conversation and passed them on embroidered with a
bit of style.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not bad,&rdquo; said Mr Dyce, blinking at
them, wondering what ailed the dears to-day.&nbsp; They were
looking uneasily around them for some way of escape; he could
almost hear the thump of their hearts, he noted the stress of
their breathing.&nbsp; Miss Jean&rsquo;s eyes fastened on the
tree-tops over the banker&rsquo;s garden wall; he felt that in a
moment she would spread out her wings and fly.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
have opened the school again,&rdquo; he said simply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We started again to-day,&rdquo; cooed Miss Jean.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we resumed to-day,&rdquo; said Miss Amelia.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The common round, the daily task.&nbsp; And, oh Mr
Dyce&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stopped suddenly at the pressure of her sister&rsquo;s
elbow on her own, and lowered her eyes, that had for a second
shown an appalling area of white.&nbsp; It was plain they were
going to fly.&nbsp; Mr Dyce felt inclined to cry &ldquo;Peas,
peas!&rdquo; and keep them a little longer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have my niece with you to-day?&rdquo; he
remarked.&nbsp; &ldquo;What do you think of her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A look of terror exchanged between them escaped his
observation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s&mdash;she&rsquo;s a wonderful child,&rdquo;
said Miss Jean, nervously twisting the strings of a hand-bag.</p>
<p><a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
70</span>&ldquo;A singularly interesting and&mdash;and unexpected
creature,&rdquo; said Miss Amelia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fairly bright, eh?&rdquo; said Mr Dyce.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, bright!&rdquo; repeated Miss Jean.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Bright is not the word for it&mdash;is it,
Amelia?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would rather say brilliant,&rdquo; said Amelia,
coughing, and plucking a handkerchief out of her pocket to inhale
its perfume and avert a threatening swound.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
hope&mdash;we both hope, Mr Dyce, she will be spared to grow up a
credit to you.&nbsp; One never knows?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; agreed Mr Dyce
cheerfully.&nbsp; &ldquo;Some girls grow up and become credits to
their parents and guardians, others become reciters, and spoil
many a jolly party with &lsquo;The Woman of Mumbles Head&rsquo;
or &lsquo;The Coffee was not Strong.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope not,&rdquo; said Miss Jean, not quite
understanding: the painful possibility seemed to be too much for
Miss Amelia; she said nothing, but fixed her eyes on the distant
tree-tops and gave a little flap of the wings of her Inverness
cape.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peas, peas!&rdquo; murmured Mr Dyce unconsciously,
anxious to hold them longer and talk about his niece.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg pardon,&rdquo; exclaimed Miss Jean, and the
lawyer got very red.&nbsp; &ldquo;I hope at least you&rsquo;ll
like Bud,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;She&rsquo;s odd,
but&mdash;but&mdash;but&mdash;&rdquo; he paused for a word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&mdash;sincere,&rdquo; suggested Miss Jean.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I would say sincere&mdash;or perhaps outspoken
would be better,&rsquo; said Miss Amelia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So clever too,&rdquo; added Miss Jean.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Preternaturally!&rdquo; cooed Miss Amelia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such a delightful accent,&rdquo; said Miss Jean.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like link&egrave;d sweetness long drawn out,&rdquo;
quoted Miss Amelia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;&rdquo; hesitated Miss Jean.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still&mdash;&rdquo; more hesitatingly said her sister,
and then there was a long pause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, to the mischief!&rdquo; said Mr Dyce to himself, <a
name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 71</span>then took off
his hat again, said &ldquo;Good afternoon,&rdquo; and turned to
his door.</p>
<p>He was met by Ailie in the lobby; she had seen him from a
window speaking to the two Miss Duffs.&nbsp; &ldquo;What were
they saying to you?&rdquo; she asked with more curiosity in her
manner than was customary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing at all,&rdquo; said Mr Dyce.&nbsp; &ldquo;They
just stood and cooed.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not sure that a doo-cot is
the best place to bring up an eagle in.&nbsp; How did Bud get on
with them at school to-day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So far as I can make out, she did not get on at all;
she seems to have demoralised the school, and driven the Miss
Duffs into hysterics, and she left of her own accord and came
home an hour before closing-time.&nbsp; And&mdash;and she&rsquo;s
not going back!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr Dyce stood a moment in amazement, then rubbed his hands
gleefully.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to hear it,&rdquo; said
he.&nbsp; &ldquo;The poor birdies between them could not summon
up courage to tell me what was wrong.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sorry for
them; if she&rsquo;s not going back, we&rsquo;ll send them down a
present&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
72</span>CHAPTER IX.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">That</span> the child should have gone to
the dame school at all was due to her Auntie Bell.&nbsp; From the
first Miss Ailie had been dubious of the seminary, but Bell was
terribly domineering; in fact, was neither to hold nor bind, and
the doo-cot it bode to be.&nbsp; A product herself of the old
dame school in the spacious days of Barbara Mushet, whose pupils
in white-seam sewing and Italian hand were nowadays married to
the best, and notable as housewives, she deemed it still the only
avenue to the character and skill that keep those queer folk,
men, when they&rsquo;re married, by their own fire-ends.&nbsp; As
for Daniel Dyce, he was, I fear, indifferent how Bud came by her
schooling, having a sort of philosophy that the gate of gifts is
closed on us the day we&rsquo;re born, and that the important
parts of the curriculum, good or bad, are picked up like a Scots
or Hielan&rsquo; accent, someway in the home.</p>
<p>So Ailie had gone reluctant to the Misses Duff and told them
that on the morrow the child would start in their academy.&nbsp;
They currookity-cooed at the prospect, put past their crocheting,
brought out their celebrated silver spoons, and made of the
afternoon tea a banquet with the aid of a seed-cake hurriedly
brought from P. &amp; A. MacGlashan&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Their home was
like a stall in a bazaar and smelt of turpentine.&nbsp; Ailie,
who loved wide spaces, sat cramped between a laden what-not and a
white-enamelled spinning-wheel, the feathers of her hat colliding
with a fretwork bracket on the wall behind her chair, and <a
name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 73</span>thinking not
unkindly of the creatures, wished that she could give them a good
shaking.&nbsp; Oh! they were so prim, pernickety, and hopelessly
in all things wrong!&nbsp; She was not very large herself, for
stature, but in their company she felt gigantic.&nbsp; And oddly
there rose in her, too, a sense of gladness that she was of a
newer kind of women than those gentle slaves, prisoned in their
primness, manacled by stupid old conceits.&nbsp; She was glad she
was free, that her happy hours were not so wasted in futilities,
that she saw farther, that she knew no social fears, that custom
had not crushed her soul, and yet she someway liked and pitied
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find her somewhat odd,&rdquo; she
explained as she nibbled the seed-cake, with a silly little
d&rsquo;oyley of Miss Jean&rsquo;s contrivance on her knee, and
the doves fluttering round her as timid of settling down as
though they had actual feathers and she were a cat.&nbsp;
&ldquo;She has got a remarkably quick intelligence; she is quite
unconventional,&mdash;quite unlike other children in many
respects, and it may be difficult at first to manage
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear me!&rdquo; said Miss Jean.&nbsp; &ldquo;What a
pity she should be so odd!&nbsp; I suppose it&rsquo;s the
American system; but perhaps she will improve.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s nothing alarming,&rdquo; explained Miss
Ailie, recovering the d&rsquo;oyley from the floor to which it
had slid from her knee, and replacing it with a wicked little
shake.&nbsp; &ldquo;If she didn&rsquo;t speak much you would
never guess from her appearance that she knew any more
than&mdash;than most of us.&nbsp; Her mother, I feel sure, was
something of a genius&mdash;at least it never came from the Dyce
side; we were all plain folk, not exactly fools, but still not
odd enough to have the dogs bite us, or our neighbours cross to
the other side of the street when they saw us coming.&nbsp; She
died two years ago, and when William&mdash;when my brother died,
Lennox was staying with professional friends of himself and his
wife, who have been good enough to let us have her, much against
their natural inclination.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
74</span>&ldquo;The dear!&rdquo; said Miss Jean, enraptured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite a sweet romance!&rdquo; cooed Miss Amelia,
languishing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may be sure we will do all we can for her,&rdquo;
continued Miss Jean, pecking with unconscious fingers at the
crumbs on her visitor&rsquo;s lap, till Ailie could scarcely keep
from smiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She will soon feel quite at home among us in our little
school,&rdquo; said Miss Amelia.&nbsp; &ldquo;No doubt
she&rsquo;ll be shy at first&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite the contrary!&rdquo; Ailie assured them, with a
little mischievous inward glee, to think how likely Bud was to
astonish them by other qualities than shyness.&nbsp; &ldquo;It
seems that in America children are brought up on wholly different
lines from children here; you&rsquo;ll find a curious fearless
independence in her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The twins held up their hands in amazement,
&ldquo;tcht-tcht-tchting&rdquo; simultaneously.&nbsp;
&ldquo;<i>What</i> a pity!&rdquo; said Miss Jean, as if it were a
physical affliction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But no doubt by carefulness and training it can be
eradicated,&rdquo; said Miss Amelia, determined to encourage
hope.</p>
<p>At that Miss Ailie lost her patience.&nbsp; She rose to go,
with a start that sent the doves more widely fluttering than ever
in their restless little parlour, so crowded out of all comfort
by its fretful toys.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you should trouble much about the
eradication,&rdquo; she said with some of her brother&rsquo;s
manner at the bar.&nbsp; &ldquo;Individuality is not painful to
the possessor like toothache, so it&rsquo;s a pity to eradicate
it or kill the nerve.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The words were out before she could prevent them; she bit her
lips, and blushed in her vexation to have said them, but luckily
the Pigeons in their agitation were not observant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like all the Dyces, a little daft!&rdquo; was what they
said of her when she was gone, and they were very different women
then, as they put on their aprons, rolled up the silver spoons in
tissue-paper and put <a name="page75"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 75</span>them in a stocking of Amelia&rsquo;s,
before they started to their crochet-work again.</p>
<p>It was a bright, expectant, happy bairn that set out next day
for the school.&nbsp; No more momentous could have seemed her
start for Scotland across the wide Atlantic; her aunties, looking
after her going down the street alone, so confident and sturdily,
rued their own arrangement, and envied the Misses Duff that were
to be blessed all day with her companionship.&nbsp; To Bell it
seemed as if the wean were walking out of their lives on that
broad road that leads our bairns to other knowledge than ours, to
other dwellings, to the stranger&rsquo;s heart.&nbsp; Once the
child turned at the corner of the church and waved her hand; Miss
Ailie took it bravely, but oh, Miss Bell!&mdash;Miss Bell! she
flew to the kitchen and stormed at Kate as she hung out at the
window, an observer too.</p>
<p>Three-and-twenty scholars were there in the doo-cot of the
Duffs&mdash;sixteen of them girls and the remainder boys, but not
boys enough as yet to be in the Grammar School.&nbsp; Miss Jean
came out and rang a tea-bell, and Bud was borne in on the tide of
youth that was still all strange to her.&nbsp; The twins stood
side by side behind a desk; noisily the children accustomed found
their seats, but Bud walked up to the teachers and held out her
hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning; I&rsquo;m Lennox Dyce,&rdquo; she said,
before they could get over their astonishment at an introduction
so unusual.&nbsp; Her voice, calm and clear, sounded to the
backmost seat and sent the children tittering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silence!&rdquo; cried Miss Jean, reddening, with a
glance at the delinquents, as she dubiously took the proffered
hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rather a nice little school,&rdquo; said Bud,
&ldquo;but a little stuffy.&nbsp; Wants air some, don&rsquo;t
it?&nbsp; What&rsquo;s the name of the sweet little boy in the
Fauntleroy suit?&nbsp; It looks as if it would be apt to be
Percy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was standing between the twins, facing the <a
name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 76</span>scholars; she
surveyed all with the look of his Majesty&rsquo;s Inspector.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush-h-h,&rdquo; murmured Miss Amelia, Miss Jean being
speechless.&nbsp; &ldquo;You will sit here,&rdquo; and she
nervously indicated a place in the front bench.&nbsp;
&ldquo;By-and-by, dear, we will see what you can do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bud took her place composedly, and rose with the rest to join
in the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer.&nbsp; The others mumbled it; for her
it was a treat to have to say it there for the first time in her
life in public.&nbsp; Into the words she put interest and appeal;
for the first time the doo-cot heard that supplication endowed
with its appropriate dignity.&nbsp; And then the work of the day
began.&nbsp; The school lay in the way of the main traffic of the
little town: they could hear each passing wheel and footstep, the
sweet &ldquo;chink, chink&rdquo; from the smithy, whence came the
smell of a sheep&rsquo;s head singeing.&nbsp; Sea-gulls and rooks
bickered and swore in the gutters of the street; from fields
behind came in a ploughman&rsquo;s whistle as he drove his team,
slicing green seas of fallow as a vessel cuts the green, green
wave.&nbsp; Four-and-twenty children, four-and-twenty souls,
fathers and mothers of the future race, all outwardly much alike
with eyes, noses, hands, and ears in the same position, how could
the poor Misses Duff know what was what in the stuff they
handled?&nbsp; Luckily for their peace of mind, it never occurred
to them that between child and child there was much odds.&nbsp;
Some had blue pinafores and some white; some were freckled and
some had warts and were wild, and these were the banker&rsquo;s
boys.&nbsp; God only knew the other variations.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas
the duty of the twins to bring them all in mind alike to the one
plain level.</p>
<p>It was lucky that the lessons of that day began with the
Shorter Catechism, for it kept the ignorance of Lennox Dyce a
little while in hiding.&nbsp; She heard with amazement of
Effectual Calling and Justification and the reasons annexed to
the fifth commandment as stammeringly and lifelessly chanted by
the others; but when her turn came, and Miss Jean, to test her,
<a name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 77</span>asked her
simply Man&rsquo;s Chief End, she answered boldly&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Man&rsquo;s chief end is to glorify God, and to enjoy
Him for ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good! <i>very</i> good indeed!&rdquo; said the
twin encouragingly.&nbsp; She was passing on to the next pupil,
when Bud burst out with her own particular reason annexed,
borrowed from the rapturous explanation of her uncle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Man is a harp,&rdquo; she said as solemnly as he had
said it&mdash;&ldquo;a har-r-rp with a thousand strings; and we
must sing, sing, sing, even if we&rsquo;re timmer as a cask, and
be grateful always, and glad in the mornings with
things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If the whistling ploughman and his team had burst into the
schoolroom it would have been no greater marvel, brought no more
alarm to the breasts of the little teachers.&nbsp; They looked at
her as if she had been a witch.&nbsp; The other pupils stared,
with open mouths.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that you say, my dear?&rdquo; said Miss
Amelia.&nbsp; &ldquo;Did you learn that in America?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Bud, &ldquo;I just found it out from
Uncle Dan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silence!&rdquo; cried Miss Jean, for now the class was
tittering again.&nbsp; She went with her sister behind the
black-board, and nervously they communed.&nbsp; Bud smiled
benignly on her fellows.</p>
<p>Just as disconcerting was her performance in geography.&nbsp;
Had they tested her in her knowledge of the United States she
might have come out triumphantly commonplace; but unfortunately
they chose to ask her of Scotland, and there her latest teacher
had been Kate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are the chief towns in Scotland?&rdquo; asked Miss
Jean.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oban, and Glasgow, and &rsquo;Tornoway,&rdquo; replied
Bud with a touch of Highland accent; and, tired of sitting so
long in one place, calmly rose and removed herself to a seat
beside the Fauntleroy boy, who was greatly put about at such a
preference.</p>
<p><a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
78</span>&ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t move about like that,
Lennox,&rdquo; explained Miss Amelia, taking her back.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not allowed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I was all pins and needles,&rdquo; said Bud
frankly, &ldquo;and I wanted to speak to Percy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear child, his name&rsquo;s not Percy, and
there&rsquo;s no speaking in school,&rdquo; exclaimed the
distressed Miss Amelia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No speaking!&nbsp; Why, you&rsquo;re speaking all the
time,&rdquo; said the child.&nbsp; &ldquo;It
ain&rsquo;t&mdash;isn&rsquo;t fair.&nbsp; Can&rsquo;t I just get
speaking a wee teeny bit to that nice girl over there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The twins looked at each other in horror: the child was a
thousand times more difficult than the worst her aunt had led
them to expect.&nbsp; A sudden unpleasant impression that their
familiar pupils seemed like wooden models beside her, came to
them both.&nbsp; But they were alarmed to see that the wooden
models were forgetting their correct deportment under the
demoralising influence of the young invader.</p>
<p>Once more they dived behind the black-board and communed.</p>
<p>There were many such instances during the day.&nbsp; Bud, used
for all her thinking years to asking explanations of what she did
not understand, never hesitated to interrogate her teachers, who
seemed to her to be merely women, like her mother, and Mrs
Molyneux, and Auntie Ailie, only a little wilted and severe,
grotesque in some degree because of their funny affected manner,
and the crochet that never was out of their hands in oral
exercises.&nbsp; She went further, she contradicted them twice,
not rudely, but as one might contradict her equals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You talk to her,&rdquo; said Miss Jean behind the
black-board where they had taken refuge again.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
declare I&rsquo;ll take a fit if this goes on!&nbsp; Did you ever
hear of such a creature?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Amelia almost cried.&nbsp; All her fixed ideas of
children were shattered at a blow.&nbsp; Here was one who did not
in the least degree fit in with the scheme <a
name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 79</span>of treatment
in the doo-cot.&nbsp; But she went forward with a look of great
severity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, coming from America and all that, and never
having been at school before, you don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she
said, &ldquo;but I must tell you that you are not behaving
nicely&mdash;not like a nice little girl at all, Lennox.&nbsp;
Nice little girls in school in this country listen, and never say
anything unless they&rsquo;re asked.&nbsp; They are respectful to
their teachers, and never ask questions, and certainly never
contradict them, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, please, Miss Duff, I wasn&rsquo;t
contradicting,&rdquo; explained Bud very soberly, &ldquo;and when
respect is called for, I&rsquo;m there with the goods.&nbsp; You
said honor was spelt with a &lsquo;u,&rsquo; and I guess you just
made a mistake, same as I might make myself, for there
ain&rsquo;t no &lsquo;u&rsquo; in honor, at least in
America.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;I never made a mistake in all my
life,&rdquo; said Miss Amelia, gasping.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Laura!&rdquo; was all that Bud replied, but in such
a tone, and with eyes so widely opened, it set half of the other
pupils tittering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by &lsquo;Oh, Laura&rsquo;?&rdquo;
asked Miss Jean.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who is Laura?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can search me,&rdquo; replied Bud composedly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Jim often said &lsquo;Oh, Laura!&rsquo; when he got a
start.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a nice thing to say,&rdquo; said Miss
Jean.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not at all ladylike.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s just a sort of profane language, and profane language
is an &lsquo;abomination unto the Lord.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it was so like Jim,&rdquo; said Bud, giggling with
recollection.&nbsp; &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s slang I&rsquo;ll stop
it,&mdash;at least I&rsquo;ll try to stop it.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m
bound to be a well-off English undefied, you know;
poppa&mdash;father fixed that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The school was demoralised without a doubt, for now the twins
were standing nervously before Bud and put on equal terms with
her in spite of themselves, and the class was openly interested
and amused&mdash;more interested and amused than it had ever been
at anything that had ever happened in the doo-cot before.&nbsp;
Miss Amelia was the first to comprehend how far she <a
name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 80</span>and her
sister had surrendered their citadel of authority to the little
foreigner&rsquo;s attack.&nbsp; &ldquo;Order!&rdquo; she
exclaimed.&nbsp; &ldquo;We will now take up poetry and
reading.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bud cheered up wonderfully at the thought of poetry and
reading, but, alas! her delight was short-lived, for the
reading-book put into her hand was but a little further on than
Auntie Ailie&rsquo;s Twopenny.&nbsp; When her turn came to read
&ldquo;My sister Ella has a cat called Tabby.&nbsp; She is black,
and has a pretty white breast.&nbsp; She has long whiskers and a
bushy white tail,&rdquo; she read with a tone of amusement that
exasperated the twins, though they could not explain to
themselves why.&nbsp; What completed Bud&rsquo;s rebellion,
however, was the poetry.&nbsp; &ldquo;Meddlesome Matty&rdquo; was
a kind of poetry she had skipped over in Chicago, plunging
straightway into the glories of the play-bills and Shakespeare,
and when she had read that&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;One ugly trick has often spoiled<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The sweetest and the best;<br />
Matilda, though a pleasant child,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; One ugly trick possessed&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>she laughed outright.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help it, Miss Duff,&rdquo; she said when
the twins showed their distress.&nbsp; &ldquo;It looks like
poetry, sure enough, for it&rsquo;s got the jaggy edges, but it
doesn&rsquo;t make any zip inside me same as poetry does.&nbsp;
It wants biff.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s &lsquo;zip&rsquo; and
&lsquo;biff&rsquo;?&rdquo; asked Miss Amelia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s a kind of tickle in your
mind,&rdquo; said Bud.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so tired,&rdquo;
she continued, rising in her seat, &ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;ll head
for home now.&rdquo;&nbsp; And before the twins had recovered
from their dumfounderment she was in the porch putting on her
cloak and hood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just let her go,&rdquo; said Miss Jean to her
sister.&nbsp; &ldquo;If she stays any longer I shall certainly
have a swoon; I feel quite weak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so Bud marched out quite cheerfully, and reached home an
hour before she was due.&nbsp; Kate met her at the door.&nbsp;
&ldquo;My stars! are you <a name="page81"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 81</span>home already?&rdquo; she exclaimed,
with a look at the town clock.&nbsp; &ldquo;You must be smart at
your schooling when they let you out of the cemetery so
soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It ain&rsquo;t a cemetery at all,&rdquo; said Bud,
standing unconcernedly in the lobby; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s just a
kindergarten.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Aunt Ailie bore down on her to overwhelm her in
caresses.&nbsp; &ldquo;What are you home for already, Bud?&rdquo;
she asked.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not time yet, is
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Bud, &ldquo;but I just couldn&rsquo;t
stay any longer.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d as lief not go back there.&nbsp;
The ladies don&rsquo;t love me.&nbsp; They&rsquo;re Sunday sort
of ladies, and give me pins and needles.&nbsp; They smile and
smile, same&rsquo;s it was done with a glove-stretcher, and
don&rsquo;t love me.&nbsp; They said I was using profound
language, and&mdash;and they don&rsquo;t love me.&nbsp; Not the
way mother and Mrs Molyneux and you and Auntie Bell and Uncle Dan
and Kate and Footles does.&nbsp; They made goo-goo-eyes at me
when I said the least thing.&nbsp; They had all those poor
kiddies up on the floor doing their little bits, and they made me
read kindergarten poetry&mdash;that was the limit!&nbsp; So I
just upped and walked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two aunts and Kate stood round her for a moment
baffled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s to be done now?&rdquo; said Aunt
Ailie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tuts!&rdquo; said Aunt Bell, &ldquo;give the wean a
drink of milk and some bread and butter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so ended Bud&rsquo;s only term in a dame school.</p>
<h2><a name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
82</span>CHAPTER X.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was a saying of Daniel
Dyce&rsquo;s that all the world is under one&rsquo;s own
waistcoat.&nbsp; We have a way of spaeing fortunes in the North,
when young, in which we count the waistcoat buttons from top to
bottom, and say&mdash;</p>
<p class="gutindent">Tinker,</p>
<p class="gutindent">Tailor,</p>
<p class="gutindent">Soldier,</p>
<p class="gutindent">Sailor,</p>
<p class="gutindent">Rich man,</p>
<p class="gutindent">Poor man,</p>
<p class="gutindent">Prodigal, or</p>
<p class="gutindent">Thief?</p>
<p>Whichever name falls upon the last button tells what is your
destiny, and after the county corps has been round our way
recruiting, I see our schoolboys with all their waistcoat
buttons, but three at the top, amissing.&nbsp; Dan Dyce had a
different formula: he said &ldquo;Luckiness, Leisure, Ill or
Well, Good World, Bad World, Heaven or Hell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not Heaven, Dan!&rdquo; said Bell.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
other place I&rsquo;ll admit, for whiles I&rsquo;m in a furious
temper over some trifle;&rdquo; to which he would answer,
&ldquo;Woman! the Kingdom of Heaven is within you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, I think sometimes, all that&rsquo;s worth while in the
world is in this little burgh, except a string quartette and a
place called Florence I have long been ettling to see if ever I
have the money.&nbsp; In this small town is every week as much of
tragedy and comedy and farce as would make a complete novel full
of laughter <a name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
83</span>and tears, that would sell in a jiffy.&nbsp; I have
started, myself, a score of them&mdash;all the essential
inspiration got from plain folk passing my window, or from
hearing a sentence dropped among women gossiping round a
well.&nbsp; Many a winter night I come in with a fine catch of
tales picked up in the by-going, as we say, and light the candles
in a hurry, and make a gallant dash at &ldquo;Captain
Consequence.&nbsp; Chapter I.&rdquo; or &ldquo;A Wild
Inheritance.&nbsp; Part I.&nbsp; The Astounding
Mary.&rdquo;&nbsp; Only the lavishness of the material hampers
me: when I&rsquo;m at &ldquo;Captain Consequence&rdquo; (which
would be a splendid sombre story of an ill life, if I ever got
beyond Chapter I. and the old scamp&rsquo;s fondness for his
mother), my wife runs in with something warm to drink, and tells
me Jonathan Campbell&rsquo;s goat has broken into the
minister&rsquo;s garden, and then I&rsquo;m off the key for
villainy; there&rsquo;s a shilling book in Jonathan&rsquo;s goat
herself.</p>
<p>But this time I&rsquo;m determined to stick by the fortunes of
the Dyce family, now that I have got myself inside their
door.&nbsp; I hope we are friends of that household, dearer to me
than the dwellings of kings (not that I have cognisance of
many).&nbsp; I hope that no matter how often or how early we rap
at the brass knocker, or how timidly, Kate will come, and in one
breath say, &ldquo;What is&rsquo;t?&nbsp; Come in!&rdquo;&nbsp;
We may hear, when we&rsquo;re in, people passing in the street,
and the wild geese call,&mdash;wild geese, wild geese! this time
I will not follow where you tempt to where are only silence and
dream,&mdash;the autumn and the summer days may cry us out to
garden and wood, but if I can manage it I will lock the door on
the inside, and shut us snugly in with Daniel Dyce and his
household, and it will be well with us then.&nbsp; Yes, yes, it
will be well with us then.</p>
<p>The wild-goose cry, heard in the nights, beyond her
comprehension, was all that Bud Dyce found foreign in that
home.&nbsp; All else was natural and familiar and friendly, for
all else she knew was love.&nbsp; But she feared at first the
&ldquo;honk, honk&rdquo; of the lone wild <a
name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 84</span>things that
burdened her with wonder and awe.&nbsp; Lying in her attic bower
at night, they seemed to her like sore mistaken wanderers,
wind-driven, lost; and so they are, I know.&nbsp; Hans Andersen
and Grimm for her had given to their kind a forlorn and fearsome
meaning.&nbsp; But Kate MacNeill had helped, to some degree,
these childish apprehensions.</p>
<p>The Highland maid had brought from Colonsay a flesh that crept
in darkness, a brain with a fantastic maggot in it; she declared
to goodness, and to Bud sometimes, that she had no life of it
with ghosts in her small back room.&nbsp; But Bud was not to let
on to her aunties.&nbsp; Forbye it was only for Kate they came,
the ghosts; did Bud not hear them last night?&nbsp; Geese!&nbsp;
No, not geese, Kate knew different, and if the thing lasted much
longer she would stay no more in this town; she would stay
nowhere, she would just go back to Colonsay.&nbsp; Not that
Colonsay was better; there were often ghosts in Colonsay&mdash;in
the winter-time, and then it behoved you to run like the
mischief, or have a fine strong lad with you for your
convoy.&nbsp; If there were no ghosts in America it was because
it cost too much to go there on the steamers.&nbsp; Harken to
yon&mdash;&ldquo;Honk, honk!&rdquo;&mdash;did ever you hear the
like of it?&nbsp; Who with their wits about them in weather like
that would like to be a ghost?&nbsp; And loud above the wind that
rocked the burgh in the cradle of the hills, loud above the
beating rain, the creak of doors and rap of shutters in that old
house, Bud and Kate together in the kitchen heard again the
&ldquo;honk, honk!&rdquo; of the geese.&nbsp; Then it was for the
child that she missed the mighty certainty of Chicago, that
Scotland somehow to her mind seemed an old unhappy place, in the
night of which went passing Duncan, murdered in his sleep, and
David Rizzio with the daggers in his breast, and Helen of
Kirkconnel Lee.&nbsp; The nights but rarely brought any fear for
her in spite of poor Kate&rsquo;s ghosts, since the warmth and
light and love of the household filled every corner of lobby and
stair, and went to bed with <a name="page85"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 85</span>her.&nbsp; When she had said her
prayer the geese might cry, the timbers of the old house crack,
Bud was lapped in the love of God and man, and tranquil.&nbsp;
But the mornings dauntened her often when she wakened to the
sound of the six o&rsquo;clock bell.&nbsp; She would feel, when
it ceased, as if all virtue were out of last night&rsquo;s love
and prayer.&nbsp; Then all Scotland and its curious scraps of
history as she had picked it up weighed on her spirit for a time;
the house was dead and empty; not ghost nor goose made her eerie,
but mankind&rsquo;s old inexplicable alarms.&nbsp; How deep and
from what distant shores comes childhood&rsquo;s wild
surmise!&nbsp; There was nothing to harm her, she knew, but the
strangeness of the dawn and a craving for life made her at these
times the awakener of the other dwellers in the house of
Dyce.</p>
<p>She would get out of bed and go next door to the room of
Ailie, and creep in bed beside her to kiss her for a little from
her dreams.&nbsp; To the aunt these morning visitations were
precious: she would take the bairn to her bosom and fall asleep
with sighs of content, the immaculate mother.&nbsp; Bud herself
could not sleep then for watching the revelation of her lovely
auntie in the dawn&mdash;the cloud on the pillow that turned to
masses of hazel hair, the cheeks and lips that seemed to redden
like flowers as the day dawned, the nook of her bosom, the pulse
of her brow.</p>
<p>Other mornings Wanton Wully&rsquo;s bell would send her in to
Bell, who would give her the warm hollow of her own place in the
blankets, while she herself got up to dress briskly for the
day&rsquo;s affairs.&nbsp; &ldquo;Just you lie down there, pet,
and sleepy-baw,&rdquo; she would say, tying her coats with trim
tight knots.&nbsp; &ldquo;You will not grow up a fine, tall,
strong girl like your Auntie Ailie if you do not take your sleep
when you can get it.&nbsp; The morning is only for done old wives
like me that have things to do and don&rsquo;t grudge doing
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She would chatter away to Bud as she dressed, a garrulous
auntie this, two things always for her <a name="page86"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 86</span>text&mdash;the pride of Scotland, and
the virtue of duty done.&nbsp; A body, she would say, was
sometimes liable to weary of the same things to be done each day,
the same tasks even-on, fires and food and cleansing, though the
mind might dwell on great deeds desirable to be accomplished, but
pleasure never came till the thing was done that was the first to
hand, even if it was only darning a stocking.&nbsp; What was Bud
going to be when she grew up?&nbsp; Bud guessed she wasn&rsquo;t
going to be anything but just a lady.&nbsp; Ah, yes, but even
ladies had to do something wise-like; there was Ailie&mdash;to go
no farther&mdash;who could have managed a business though her
darning was but lumpy.&nbsp; Even for a lady there was nothing
nobler than the making of her own bed; besides the doctors said
it was remarkably efficacious for the figure.</p>
<p>Bud, snug in her auntie&rsquo;s blankets, only her nose and
her bright bead eyes showing in the light of the twirly wooden
candlestick, guessed Mrs Molyneux was the quickest woman to get
through work ever she saw: why she just waved it to one side and
went out to shop or lunch with Jim.</p>
<p>A look of pity for Mrs Molyneux, the misguided, would come to
Bell&rsquo;s face, but for those folk in America she never had a
word of criticism in the presence of the child.&nbsp; All she
could say was America was different.&nbsp; America was not
Scotland.&nbsp; And Scotland was not England, though in many
places they called Scotch things English.</p>
<p>Jim used to say, speaking of father, that a Scotsman was a
kind of superior Englishman.</p>
<p>Bell wished to goodness she could see the man,&mdash;he must
have been a clever one!</p>
<p>Other mornings again would the child softly open her
uncle&rsquo;s door and he would get a terrible fright, crying
&ldquo;Robbers! but you&rsquo;ll get nothing.&nbsp; I have my
watch in my boots, and my money in my mouth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She would creep beside him, and in these early hours began her
education.&nbsp; She was learning Ailie&rsquo;s calm and
curiosity and ambition; she was learning <a
name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 87</span>Bell&rsquo;s
ideas of duty and the ancient glory of her adopted land; from her
uncle she was learning many things, of which the least that
seemed useful at the time was the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer in
Latin.&nbsp; &ldquo;Pater Noster qui es in
coelis&rdquo;&mdash;that and a few hundreds of Trayner&rsquo;s
Latin maxims was nearly all of the classic tongue that survived
with the lawyer from student days.&nbsp; It was just as good and
effective a prayer in English, he admitted, but somehow, whiles,
the language was so old it brought you into closer grips with the
original.&nbsp; Some mornings she would hum to him coon songs
heard in her former home; and if he was in trim he himself would
sing some psalm to the tune of Coleshill, French, Bangor, or
Torwood.&nbsp; His favourite was Torwood; it mourned
so&mdash;mourned so!&nbsp; Or at other times a song like
&ldquo;Mary Morison.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you bumming away at up there the pair of
you?&rdquo; Bell would cry, coming to the stair-foot.&nbsp;
&ldquo;If you sing before breakfast, you&rsquo;ll greet before
night!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t she like singing in the morning?&rdquo; Bud
asked, nestling beside him, and he laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an old freit&mdash;an old
superstition,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that it&rsquo;s unlucky to
begin the day too blithely.&nbsp; It must have been a doctor that
started it, but you would wonder at the number of good and douce
Scots folk, plain bodies like ourselves, that have the notion in
their mind from infancy, and never venture a cheep or chirrup
before the day&rsquo;s well aired.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My stars! ain&rsquo;t she Scotch, Auntie Bell?&rdquo;
said Bud.&nbsp; &ldquo;So was father.&nbsp; He would sing any
time; he would sing if it broke a tooth; but he was pretty Scotch
other ways.&nbsp; Once he wore a pair of kilts to a Cale&mdash;to
a Caledonian Club.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t keep a kilt myself,&rdquo; said her
uncle.&nbsp; &ldquo;The thing&rsquo;s not strictly necessary
unless you&rsquo;re English and have a Hielan&rsquo;
shooting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Auntie Bell is the genuine Scotch stuff, I
guess!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no concealing the fact that she
is,&rdquo; her uncle admitted.&nbsp; &ldquo;She&rsquo;s so Scotch
that I am afraid she&rsquo;s apt to think of God as a countryman
of her own.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 88</span>And
there were the hours that Ailie gave with delight to Bud&rsquo;s
more orthodox tuition.&nbsp; The back room that was called
Dan&rsquo;s study, because he sometimes took a nap there after
dinner, became a schoolroom.&nbsp; There was a Mercator&rsquo;s
map of the world on the wall and another of Europe, that of
themselves gave the place the right academy aspect.&nbsp; With
imagination, a map, and the Golden Treasury, you might have as
good as a college education, according to Ailie.&nbsp; They went
long voyages together on Mercator; saw marvellous places;
shivered at the poles or languished in torrid plains, sometimes
before Kate could ring the bell for breakfast.&nbsp; There seemed
no spot in the world that this clever auntie had not some
knowledge of.&nbsp; How eagerly they crossed continents, how
ingeniously they planned routes!&nbsp; For the lengths of rivers,
the heights of mountains, the values of exports, and all the
trivial passing facts that mar the great game of geography for
many childish minds, they had small consideration; what they
gathered in their travels were sounds, colours, scenes, weather,
and the look of races.&nbsp; What adventures they had! as when,
pursued by elephants and tigers, they sped in a flash from Bengal
to the Isle of Venice, and saw the green slime of the sea on her
steeping palaces.&nbsp; Yes, the world is all for the folk of
imagination.&nbsp; &ldquo;Love maps and you will never be too old
or too poor to travel,&rdquo; was Ailie&rsquo;s motto.&nbsp; She
found a hero or a heroine for every spot upon Mercator, and
nourished so the child in noble admirations.</p>
<p>You might think it would always be the same pupil and the same
teacher, but no, they sometimes changed places.&nbsp; If Ailie
taught Bud her own love for the lyrics that are the best work of
men in their hours of exaltation, Bud sent Ailie back to her
Shakespeare, and sweet were the days they spent in Arden or
Prospero&rsquo;s Isle.</p>
<p>It was well with them then; it was well with the woman and the
child, and they were happy.</p>

89</span>CHAPTER XI.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">But</span> the Dyces never really knew how
great and serious was the charge bequeathed to them in their
brother William&rsquo;s daughter till they saw it all one night
in March in the light of a dozen penny candles.</p>
<p>Lennox had come from a world that&rsquo;s lit by electricity,
and for weeks she was sustained in wonder and amusement by the
paraffin lamps of Daniel Dyce&rsquo;s dwelling.&nbsp; They were,
she was sure, the oldest kind of light in all the world,
Aladdin-lights that gleamed of old on caverns of gems, till Kate
on this particular evening came into the kitchen with the
week-end groceries.&nbsp; It was a stormy season&mdash;the year
of the big winds; moanings were at the windows, sobbings in the
chimney-heads, and the street was swept by spindrift rain.&nbsp;
Bell and Ailie and their brother sat in the parlour, silent,
playing cards with a dummy hand, and Bud, with Footles in her
lap, behind the winter-dykes on which clothes dried before the
kitchen fire, crouched on the fender with a Shakespeare, where
almost breathlessly she read the great, the glorious Macbeth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My stars! what a night!&rdquo; said Kate.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The way them slates and chimney-cans are flying!&nbsp; It
must be the anti-nuptial gales.&nbsp; I thought every minute
would be my next.&nbsp; Oh towns! towns!&nbsp; Stop you till I
get back to Colonsay, and I&rsquo;ll not leave it in a hurry,
I&rsquo;ll assure you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She threw a parcel on the kitchen-dresser, and turned to the
light a round and rosy face that streamed with clean cooling
rain, her hair in tangles <a name="page90"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 90</span>on her temples and her eyes sparkling
with the light of youth and adventure,&mdash;for to tell the
truth she had been flirting at the door a while, in spite of all
the rain, with some admirer.</p>
<p>Bud was the sort of child whose fingers itch in the presence
of unopened parcels: in a moment the string was untied from the
week-end groceries.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Candles!&rdquo; she cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, that
beats the band!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve seen &rsquo;em in windows.&nbsp;
What in the world are you going to do with candles?&nbsp; One,
two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven,
twelve&mdash;oh Laura, ain&rsquo;t we grand!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What would we do with them but burn them?&rdquo; said
the maid; &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll use them in the
washing-house,&rdquo; and then she sank into a chair.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Mercy on me, I declare I&rsquo;m dying!&rdquo; she
exclaimed in a different key, and Bud looked round and saw
Kate&rsquo;s face had grown of a sudden very pale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh dear! what is the matter?&rdquo; she asked, her eyes
large, innocent, and anxious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pains,&rdquo; moaned the maid.&nbsp; &ldquo;Pains
inside me and all over me, and shiverings down the spine of the
back.&nbsp; Oh, it&rsquo;s a sore thing pain, especially when
it&rsquo;s bad!&nbsp; But don&rsquo;t&mdash;don&rsquo;t say a
word to the mustress; I&rsquo;m not that old, and maybe
I&rsquo;ll get better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try pain-killer,&rdquo; recommended Bud.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And if I was you I&rsquo;d start just here and say a
prayer.&nbsp; Butt right in and I&rsquo;ll not listen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pain-killer!&mdash;what in all the world&rsquo;s
pain-killer?&nbsp; I never heard of it.&nbsp; And the only prayer
I know is &lsquo;My Father which art&rsquo; in Gaelic, and
there&rsquo;s nothing in it about pains in the spine of the
back.&nbsp; No, no I&rsquo;ll just have to take a tablespoonful
of something or other three times a-day, the way I did when the
doctor put me right in Colonsay.&nbsp; Perhaps it&rsquo;s just a
chill&mdash;but oh! I&rsquo;m sorrowful, sorrowful!&rdquo; and
Kate, the colour coming slowly back to her, wept softly to
herself, rocking in the kitchen chair.&nbsp; It was sometimes by
those odd hysterics that she paid for her elations with the
lads.</p>
<p><a name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
91</span>&ldquo;I know what&rsquo;s wrong with you,&rdquo; said
Bud briskly, in the manner of Mrs Molyneux.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s just the croodles.&nbsp; Bless you, you poor
perishing soul!&nbsp; I take the croodles myself when it&rsquo;s
a night like this, and I&rsquo;m alone.&nbsp; The croodles
ain&rsquo;t the least wee bit deadly; you can put them away by
hustling at your work, or banging an old piano, or reading a
story, or playing that you&rsquo;re somebody else&mdash;Well, I
declare I think I could cure you right now with these twelve
candles, far better than you&rsquo;d do by shooting drugs into
yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never took a single candle in all my life,&rdquo;
said Kate, &ldquo;far less twelve, and I&rsquo;ll die
first&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silly!&rdquo; exclaimed Bud.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;d
think to hear you speak you were a starving Eskimo.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t want you to eat the candles.&nbsp; Wait a
minute.&rdquo;&nbsp; She ran lightly upstairs, and was gone for
ten minutes.</p>
<p>Kate&rsquo;s colour all revived; she forgot her croodles in
the spirit of anticipation that the child had roused.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Oh, but she&rsquo;s the clever one that!&rdquo; she said
to herself, drying the rain and tears from her face and starting
to nibble a biscuit.&nbsp; &ldquo;She knows as much as two
ministers, and still she&rsquo;s not a bit proud.&nbsp; Some day
she&rsquo;ll do something desperate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Bud came back she startled the maid by her appearance,
for she had clad herself, for the first time in Scotland, with a
long, thin, copious dancing-gown, in which a lady of the
vaudeville, a friend of Mrs Molyneux&rsquo;s, had taught her
dancing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t this dandy?&rdquo; she said, closing the
kitchen door, and there was a glow upon her countenance and a
movement of her body that, to the maid&rsquo;s eyes, made her
look a little woman.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t this bully?&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t you stand there looking like a dying Welsh rabbit,
but help me light them candles for the footlights.&nbsp; Why! I
knew there was some use for these old candles first time I set
eyes on them; they made me think of something I couldn&rsquo;t
&rsquo;zactly think of&mdash;made me kind of gay, you know, just
as if I was going to the theatre.&nbsp; They&rsquo;re only
candles, but <a name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
92</span>there&rsquo;s twelve lights to them all at once, and now
you&rsquo;ll see some fun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What in the world are you going to do, lassie?&rdquo;
asked the maid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to be a Gorgeous Entertainment;
I&rsquo;m going to be the Greatest Agg&mdash;Aggregation of
Historic Talent now touring the Middle West.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m
Mademoiselle Winifred Wallace of Madison Square Theatre, New
York, positively appearing here for one night only.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m the whole company, and the stage manager, and the band,
and the boys that throw the bouquets.&nbsp; Biff!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m
checked high: all you&rsquo;ve got to do is to sit there with
your poor croodles and feel them melt away.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s
light the foot-lights.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a row of old brass bedroom candlesticks on the
kitchen-shelf that were seldom used now in the house of Dyce,
though their polish was the glory of Miss Bell&rsquo;s
heart.&nbsp; The child kilted up her gown, jumped on a chair, and
took them down with the help of Kate.&nbsp; She stuck in each a
candle, and ranged them in a semicircle on the floor, then lit
the candles and took her place behind them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put out the lamp!&rdquo; she said to Kate, in the
common voice of actors&rsquo; tragedy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed and I&rsquo;ll do nothing of the kind,&rdquo;
said the maid.&nbsp; &ldquo;If your Auntie Bell comes in
she&rsquo;ll&mdash;she&rsquo;ll skin me alive for letting you
play such cantrips with her candles.&nbsp; Forbye, you&rsquo;re
going to do something desperate, something that&rsquo;s not
canny, and I must have the lamp behind me or I&rsquo;ll lose my
wits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Woman, put out the light!&rdquo; repeated Bud, with an
imperious pointing finger, and, trembling, Kate turned down the
lamp upon the wall and blew down the chimney in the very way Miss
Dyce was always warning her against.&nbsp; She gasped at the
sudden change the loss of the light made&mdash;at the sense of
something idolatrous and bewitched in the arc of flames on her
kitchen-floor, each blown inward from the draught of a rattling
window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it is <i>buidseachas</i>&mdash;if it is witchcraft
of any kind <a name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
93</span>you are on for, I&rsquo;ll not have it,&rdquo; said Kate
firmly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I never saw the like of this since the old
woman in Pennyland put the curse on the Colonsay factor, and she
had only seven candles.&nbsp; Dear, dear Lennox, do not do
anything desperate; do not be carrying on, for you are
frightening me out of my judgment.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m&mdash;I&rsquo;m maybe better now, I took a bite at a
biscuit; indeed I&rsquo;m quite better, it was nothing but the
cold&mdash;and a lad out there that tried to kiss me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bud paid no heed, but plucked up the edges of her skirt in
outstretched hands and glided into the last dance she had learned
from the vaudeville lady, humming softly to herself an
appropriate tune.&nbsp; The candles warmly lit her neck, her
ears, her tilted nostrils, her brow was high in shadow.&nbsp;
First she rose on tiptoe and made her feet to twitter on the
flags, then swayed and swung a little body that seemed to hang in
air.&nbsp; The white silk swept around and over her&mdash;wings
with no noise of flapping feather, or swirled in sea-shell coils,
that rose in a ripple from her ankles and swelled in wide
circling waves above her head, revealing her in glimpses like
some creature born of foam on fairy beaches, and holding the
command of tempest winds.&nbsp; Ah, dear me! many and many a time
I saw her dance just so in her daft days before the chill of
wisdom and reflection came her way; she was a passion
disembodied, an aspiration realised, a happy morning thought, a
vapour, a perfume of flowers, for her attire had lain in
lavender.&nbsp; She was the spirit of Spring, as I have felt it
long ago in little woods, or seen it in pictures, or heard it in
songs; she was an ecstasy, she was a dream.</p>
<p>The dog gave a growl of astonishment, then lay his length on
the hearth-rug, his nose between his paws, his eyes fixed on
her.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not have it,&rdquo; said the maid
piteously.&nbsp; &ldquo;At least I&rsquo;ll not stand much of it,
for it&rsquo;s not canny to be carrying-on like that in a
Christian dwelling.&nbsp; I never did the like of that in all my
life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Every</i> move a picture,&rdquo; said the child, and
still <a name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
94</span>danced on, with the moan of the wind outside for a bass
to her low-hummed melody.&nbsp; Her stretching folds flew high,
till she seemed miraculous tall, and to the servant&rsquo;s fancy
might have touched the low ceiling; then she sank&mdash;and
sank&mdash;and sank till her forehead touched the floor, and she
was a flower fallen, the wind no more to stir its petals, the
rain no more to glisten on its leaves.&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas as if
she shrivelled and died there, and Kate gave one little cry that
reached the players of cards in the parlour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush! what noise was that?&rdquo; said Ailie, lifting
her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be Kate clumping across the kitchen-floor in
the Gaelic language,&rdquo; said Mr Dyce, pushing his specs up on
his brow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing but the wind,&rdquo; said Bell.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What did you say was trumph?&rdquo;&mdash;for that was the
kind of player she was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was not the wind, it was a cry; I&rsquo;m sure I
heard a cry.&nbsp; I hope there&rsquo;s nothing wrong with the
little one,&rdquo; said Ailie, with a throbbing heart, and she
threw her cards on the table and went out.&nbsp; She came back in
a moment, her face betraying her excitement, her voice demanding
silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of all the wonders!&rdquo; said she.&nbsp; &ldquo;Just
step this way, people, to the pantry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They rose and followed her.&nbsp; The pantry was all
darkness.&nbsp; Through its partly open door that led into the
kitchen they saw their child in the crescent of the candles,
though she could not see them, as no more could Kate, whose chair
was turned the other way.&nbsp; They stood in silence watching
the strange performance, each with different feelings, but all
with eeriness, silent people of the placid, old, half-rustic
world, that lives for ever with realities, and seldom sees the
passions counterfeited.</p>
<p>Bud had risen, her dark hair looking unnaturally black above
her brow, and, her dancing done, she was facing the dog and the
servant, the only audience of whose presence she was aware.</p>
<p><a name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
95</span>&ldquo;Toots!&rdquo; said the maid, relieved that all
seemed over, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s nothing in the way of dancing;
you should see them dancing Gillie-Callum over-bye in
Colonsay!&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a dancer so strong there that he
breaks the very boards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bud looked at her, and yet not wholly at her&mdash;through
her, with burning eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; she said, trembling.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you
not hear something?&rdquo; and at that moment, high over the town
went the &ldquo;honk, honk&rdquo; of the wild geese.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Devil the thing but geeses!&rdquo; said the maid, whose
blood had curdled for a second.&nbsp; The rain swept like a broom
along the street, the gutters bubbled, the shutters rapped, far
above the dwelling went the sound of the flying geese.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, hush, woman, hush!&rdquo; implored the child, her
hands over her ears, her figure cowering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only the geeses.&nbsp; What a start you gave
me!&rdquo; said the maid again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; said Bud, &ldquo;Methought I heard a
voice cry &lsquo;Sleep no more!&nbsp; Macbeth does murder sleep,
the innocent sleep, Sleep that knits up the ravell&rsquo;d sleave
of care, sore labour&rsquo;s bath, Balm of hurt minds, great
nature&rsquo;s second course, Chief nourisher in life&rsquo;s
feast&mdash;&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; cried Kate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still it cried, &lsquo;Sleep no more!&rsquo; to all the
house: Glamis hath murder&rsquo;d sleep, and therefore Cawdor
shall sleep no more; Macbeth shall sleep no more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The child filled each phrase with a travesty of passion; she
had seen the part enacted.&nbsp; It was not, be sure, a great
performance.&nbsp; Some words were strangely mutilated; but it
was a child, and she had more than a child&rsquo;s command of
passion&mdash;she had feeling, she had heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot look at you!&rdquo; exclaimed Kate.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You are not canny, but oh! you are&mdash;you are
majestic!&nbsp; There was never the like of it in all the
isles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bell, in the darkness of the pantry, wept silently at some
sense of sin in this play-acting on a Saturday <a
name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 96</span>night; her
brother held her arm tightly; Ailie felt a vague unrest and
discontent with herself, a touch of envy and of shame.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please collect the bouquets,&rdquo; said the child,
seating herself on the floor with her knees tucked high in her
gown.&nbsp; &ldquo;Are the croodles all gone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It did me a lot of good yon dancing,&rdquo; said
Kate.&nbsp; &ldquo;Did you put yon words about Macbeth sleep no
more together yourself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Bud, and then repented.&nbsp;
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she added hurriedly, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s a fib;
please, God, give me a true tongue.&nbsp; It was made by
Shakespeare&mdash;dear old Will!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I never heard of the man in all my life
before; but he must have been a bad one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Kate, you are as fresh as the mountain
breeze,&rdquo; said Bud.&nbsp; &ldquo;He was Great!&nbsp; He was
born at Stratford-on-Avon, a poor boy, and went to London and
held horses outside the theatre door, and then wrote plays so
grand that only the best can act them.&nbsp; He was&mdash;he was
not for an age, but all the time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had borrowed the lesson as well as the manner of Auntie
Ailie, who smiled in the dark of the pantry at this glib
rendering of herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I should love to play Rosalind,&rdquo; continued
the child.&nbsp; &ldquo;I should love to play everything.&nbsp;
When I am big, and really Winifred Wallace, I will go all over
the world and put away people&rsquo;s croodles same as I did
yours, Kate, and they will love me; and I will make them feel
real good, and sometimes cry&mdash;for that is beautiful
too.&nbsp; I will never rest, but go on, and on, and on; and
everywhere everybody will know about me&mdash;even in the tiny
minstrel towns where they have no or&rsquo;nary luck but just
coon shows, for it&rsquo;s in these places croodles must be most
catching.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll go there and play for nothing, just to
show them what a dear soul Rosalind was.&nbsp; I want to grow
fast, fast!&nbsp; I want to be tall like my Auntie Ailie, and
lovely like my dear Auntie Ailie, and clever like my sweet sweet
Aunt Ailie.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
97</span>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s big enough and bonny enough, and
clever enough in some things,&rdquo; said the maid; &ldquo;but
can she sew like her sister!&mdash;tell me that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sew!&rdquo; exclaimed the child, with a frown.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I hate sewing.&nbsp; I guess Auntie Ailie&rsquo;s like me,
and feels sick when she starts a hem and sees how long it is, and
all to be gone over with small stitches.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, indeed I do,&rdquo; whispered Ailie in the
pantry, and she was trembling.&nbsp; She told me later how she
felt of her conviction then that for her the years of opportunity
were gone, the golden years that had slipped past in the little
burgh town without a chance for her to grasp their
offerings.&nbsp; She told me of her resolution there and then
that this child, at least, should have its freedom to expand.</p>
<p>Bud crept to the end of the crescent of her footlights and
blew out the candles slowly one by one.&nbsp; The last she left
a-light a little longer, and, crouched upon the floor, she gazed
with large and dreaming eyes into its flame as if she read
there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is over now,&rdquo; said Mr Dyce in a whisper to his
sisters, and, with his hands on their shoulders led them back
into the parlour.</p>
<h2><a name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
98</span>CHAPTER XII.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">She</span> was wayward, she was
passionate, she was sometimes wild.&nbsp; She was not what, in
the Pigeons&rsquo; Seminary, could be called a good child, for
all her sins were frankly manifest, and she knew no fear nor
naughty stratagem; her mind, to all but Kate, was open as the
day, and there it was the fault of honest Kate&rsquo;s
stupidity.&nbsp; But often Miss Bell must be moaning at
transgressions almost harmless in themselves, yet so terribly
unlike a Christian bairn, as when Bud spent an afternoon in a
tent with some gipsy children, changed clothes with them the
better to act a part, and stormed because she could not have them
in to tea with her.&nbsp; Or when she asked Lady Anne,
bazaar-collecting in the house of Dyce, if she ever had had a
proposal.&nbsp; It was a mercy that Lady Anne that very week had
had one, and was only too pleased to tell of it and say she had
accepted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then <i>you&rsquo;re</i> safe out of the woods,&rdquo;
said Bud gravely.&nbsp; &ldquo;There&rsquo;s our Kate, she
hasn&rsquo;t had a proposal yet, and I guess she&rsquo;s on the
slopey side of thirty.&nbsp; It must be dre&rsquo;ffle to be as
old&mdash;as old as a house and have no beau to love you.&nbsp;
It must be &rsquo;scrutiating.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lady Anne let her eyes turn for a moment on the sisters Dyce,
and the child observed and reddened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! Auntie Bell!&rdquo; she said quickly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Auntie Bell had heaps and heaps of beaux all dying to
marry her, but she gave them the calm cold eye and said she had
to cling to Uncle Dan.&nbsp; It was very noble of her,
wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
99</span>&ldquo;Indeed it was!&rdquo; admitted Lady Anne, very
much ashamed of herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Auntie Ailie is not on the slopey side of
thirty,&rdquo; continued Bud, determined to make all
amends.&nbsp; &ldquo;She&rsquo;s young enough to love
dolls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Bell who censured her for this dreadful
behaviour.&nbsp; &ldquo;You are a perfect torment, Lennox,&rdquo;
she said, at the first opportunity.&nbsp; &ldquo;A bairn like you
must not be talking about beaux, and love, and proposals, and
nonsense of that kind,&mdash;it&rsquo;s fair
ridiculous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I thought love was the Great Thing!&rdquo;
exclaimed Bud, much astonished.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s in all
the books, there&rsquo;s hardly anything else, &rsquo;cept when
somebody is murdered and you know that the man who did it is the
only one you don&rsquo;t suspect.&nbsp; Indeed, Auntie, I thought
it was the Great Thing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so it is, my dear,&rdquo; said Ailie.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s very little else in all the world,
except&mdash;except the children,&rdquo; and she folded her niece
in her arms.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is the Great Thing; it has made Lady
Anne prettier than ever she was in her life before, it has made
her brighter, humbler, gentler, kinder.&nbsp; God bless her, I
hope she will be happy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it was very wrong; it was a kind of fib for you to
talk about me having lots of lads in my time,&rdquo; said Auntie
Bell.&nbsp; &ldquo;You do not know whether I had or
not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bud looked at her and saw a flush on her face.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
think,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;the beaux must have been very
stupid, then.&nbsp; But I guess there must have been one, Auntie
Bell, and you have forgotten all about him.&rdquo;&nbsp; And at
that Miss Bell went hurriedly from the room, with a pretence that
she heard a pot boil over, and Ailie in a low voice told her
niece all about Bell&rsquo;s beau, deep drowned in the Indian
Ocean.</p>
<p>For days after that the child was tender with her elder aunt,
and made a splendid poem in blank verse upon the late Captain
James Murray, which Bell was never to see, but Ailie
treasured.&nbsp; For days was she <a name="page100"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 100</span>angelic good.&nbsp; Her rages never
came to fever heat.&nbsp; Her rebellions burned themselves out in
her bosom.&nbsp; Nobly she struggled with Long Division and the
grammar that she abominated; very meekly she took censure for
copy-books blotted and words shamefully misspelled in Uncle
Daniel&rsquo;s study.&nbsp; Some way this love that she had
thought a mere amusement, like shopping in Chicago, took a new
complexion in her mind&mdash;became a dear and solemn thing, like
her uncle&rsquo;s Bible readings, when, on Sunday nights at
worship in the parlour, he took his audience through the desert
to the Promised Land, and the abandoned street was vocal with
domestic psalm from the Provost&rsquo;s open windows.&nbsp; She
could not guess&mdash;how could she, the child?&mdash;that love
has its variety.&nbsp; She thought there was but the one love in
all the world,&mdash;the same she felt herself for most
things,&mdash;a gladness and agreement with things as they
were.&nbsp; And yet at times in her reading she got glimpses of
love&rsquo;s terror and empire, as in the stories of Othello and
of Amy Robsart, and herself began to wish she had a lover.&nbsp;
She thought at first of Uncle Dan; but he could not be serious,
and she had never heard him sigh,&mdash;in him was wanting some
remove, some mystery.&nbsp; What she wanted was a lover on a
milk-white steed, a prince who was &ldquo;the flower o&rsquo;
them a&rsquo;,&rdquo; as in Aunt Ailie&rsquo;s song
&ldquo;Glenlogie&rdquo;; and she could not imagine Uncle Dan with
his spectacles on riding any kind of steed, though she felt it
would be nice to have him with her when the real prince was
there.</p>
<p>Do you think it unlikely that this child should have such
dreams?&nbsp; Ah, then, you are not of her number, or you have
forgotten.&nbsp; She never forgot.&nbsp; Many a time she told me
in after-years of how in the attic bower, with Footles snug at
her feet, she conjured up the lad on the milk-white steed, not so
much for himself alone, but that she might act the
lady-love.&nbsp; And in those dreams she was tall and slender,
sometimes proud, disdainful, wounding the poor wretch <a
name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 101</span>with sharp
words and cold glances; or she was meek and languishing, sighing
out her heart even in presence of his true-love gifts of candy
and P. &amp; A. MacGlashan&rsquo;s penny tarts.&nbsp; She walked
with him in gardens enchanted; they sailed at nights over calm
moonlit seas, and she would be playing the lute.&nbsp; She did
not know what the lute was like; but it was the instrument of
love, and had a dulcet sound, like the alto flutes in the burgh
band.</p>
<p>But, of course, no fairy prince came wooing Daniel
Dyce&rsquo;s little niece, though men there were in the
place&mdash;elderly and bald, with married daughters&mdash;who
tried to buy her kisses for sixpences and sweets, and at last she
felt vicariously the joys of love by conducting the affairs of
Kate.</p>
<p>Kate had many wooers,&mdash;that is the solace of her
class.&nbsp; They liked her because she was genial and plump,
with a flattering smile and a soft touch of the Gaelic accent
that in the proper key and hour is the thing to break
hearts.&nbsp; She twirled them all round her little finger, and
Bud was soon to see this and to learn that the maid was still
very far from the slopey side of thirty.&nbsp; But Kate, too, had
her dreams&mdash;of some misty lad of the mind, with short,
curled hair, clothes brass-buttoned, and a delicious smell of
tar&mdash;something or other on a yacht.&nbsp; The name she had
endowed him with was Charles.&nbsp; She made him up from passing
visions of seamen on the quays, and of notions gleaned from her
reading of penny novelettes.</p>
<p>One week-night Bud came on her in the kitchen dressed in her
Sunday clothes and struggling with a spluttering pen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you at your lessons too?&rdquo; said the
child.&nbsp; &ldquo;You naughty Kate! there&rsquo;s a horrid
blot.&nbsp; No lady makes blots.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t me, it was this devilish pen; besides,
I&rsquo;m not a lady,&rdquo; said Kate, licking the latest blot
with her tongue and grimacing.&nbsp; &ldquo;What way do you spell
weather?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;W-e-t-h-e-r,&rdquo; said Bud.&nbsp; &ldquo;At least, I
think that&rsquo;s <a name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
102</span>the way! but I&rsquo;d best run and ask Aunt
Ailie,&mdash;she&rsquo;s a speller from Spellerville.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed and you&rsquo;ll do nothing of the kind,&rdquo;
cried the maid, alarmed and reddening.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll
do nothing of the kind, Lennox, because&mdash;I&rsquo;m writing
to Charles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A love-letter!&nbsp; Oh, I&rsquo;ve got you with the
goods on you!&rdquo; exclaimed Bud, enchanted.&nbsp; &ldquo;And
what are you doing with your hurrah clothes on?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like to put on my Sunday clothes when I&rsquo;m
writing Charles,&rdquo; said the maid, a little put-about.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Do you think it&rsquo;s kind of daft?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not daft at all, it&rsquo;s real &rsquo;cute
of you; it&rsquo;s what I do myself when I&rsquo;m writing
love-letters, for it makes me feel kind of grander.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s just the same with poetry; I simply can&rsquo;t make
sure enough poetry unless I have on a nice frock and my hands
washed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You</i> write love-letters!&rdquo; said the maid,
astounded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you poor perishing soul!&rdquo; retorted
Bud.&nbsp; &ldquo;And you needn&rsquo;t yelp.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve
written scores of love-letters without stopping to take
breath.&nbsp; Stop! stop!&rdquo; she interrupted herself, and
breathed an inward little prayer.&nbsp; &ldquo;I mean that I
write them&mdash;well, kind of write them&mdash;in my
mind.&rdquo;&nbsp; But this was a qualification beyond
Kate&rsquo;s comprehension.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I wish you would give me a hand with this
one,&rdquo; said she despairingly.&nbsp; &ldquo;All the nice
words are so hard to spell, and this is such a bad
pen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re <i>all</i> bad pens; they&rsquo;re all
devilish,&rdquo; said Bud, from long experience.&nbsp; &ldquo;But
I&rsquo;d love to help you write that letter.&nbsp; Let me
see&mdash;pooh! it&rsquo;s dreffle bad, Kate.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t
read a bit of it, almost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure and neither can I,&rdquo; said Kate,
distressed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then how in the world do you expect Charles to read
it?&rdquo; asked Bud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;s&mdash;he&rsquo;s a better scholar than
me,&rdquo; said Kate complacently.&nbsp; &ldquo;But you might
write this one for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bud washed her hands, took a chair to the kitchen table, threw
back her hair from her eyes, and eagerly <a
name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 103</span>entered
into the office of love-letter-writer.&nbsp; &ldquo;What will I
say to him?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear, dear Charles,&rdquo; said the maid, who at
least knew so much.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My adorable Charles,&rdquo; said Bud, as an
improvement, and down it went with the consent of the
dictator.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m keeping fine, and I&rsquo;m very busy,&rdquo;
suggested Kate, upon deliberation.&nbsp; &ldquo;The weather is
capital here at present, and it is a good thing, for the farmers
are busy with their hay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bud sat back and stared at her in amazement.&nbsp; &ldquo;Are
you sure this is for a Charles?&rdquo; she asked.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You might as well call him Sissy and talk frocks.&nbsp;
Why! you must tell him how you love him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t like,&rdquo; said Kate,
confused.&nbsp; &ldquo;It sounds so&mdash;so bold and impudent
when you put it in the English and write it down.&nbsp; But
please yourself; put down what you like, and I&rsquo;ll be
dipping the pen for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bud was not slow to take the opportunity.&nbsp; For half an
hour she sat at the kitchen table and searched her soul for
fitting words that would convey Kate&rsquo;s adoration.&nbsp;
Once or twice the maid asked what she was writing, but all she
said was &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, Kate.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m right in
the throes.&rdquo;&nbsp; There were blots and there were
erasions, but something like this did the epistle look when it
was done:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">My adorable
Charles</span>,&mdash;I am writeing this letter to let you know
how much I truly love you.&nbsp; Oh Charles, dear, you are the
Joy of my heart.&nbsp; I am thinking of you so often, often, till
my Heart just aches.&nbsp; It is lovely wether here at
present.&nbsp; Now I will tell you all about the Games.&nbsp;
They took place in a park near here Friday and there was
seventeen beautiful dancers.&nbsp; They danced to give you
spassums.&nbsp; One of them was a Noble youth.&nbsp; He was a
Prince in his own write, under Spells for sevn years.&nbsp; When
he danced, lo and behold he was the admiration of <a
name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 104</span>all
Beholders.&nbsp; Alas! poor youth.&nbsp; When I say alas I mean
that it was so sad being like that full of Spells in the flower
of his youth.&nbsp; He looked at me so sad when he was dancing,
and I was so glad.&nbsp; It was just like money from home.&nbsp;
Dear Charles, I will tell you all about myself.&nbsp; I am full
of goodness most the time for God loves good people.&nbsp; But
sometimes I am not and I have a temper like two crost sticks when
I must pray to be changed.&nbsp; The dancing gentleman truly
loves me to distruction.&nbsp; He kissed my hand and hastily
mountain his noble steed, galoped furiously away.&nbsp; Ah, the
coarse of true love never did run smooth.&nbsp; Perhaps he will
fall upon the forein plain.&nbsp; Dearest
Charles&mdash;adorable&mdash;I must now tell you that I am being
educated for my proper station in life.&nbsp; There is Geograpy,
and penmanship with the right commas, and Long Division and
conjunctives which I abomiate.&nbsp; But my teacher, a sweet lady
named Miss Alison Dyce, says they are all truly refining.&nbsp;
Oh I am weary, weary, he cometh not.&nbsp; That is for you,
darling Charles, my own.&mdash;Your true heart love,</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><span class="smcap">Kate
MacNeill</span>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Is that all right?&rdquo; asked Bud anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; at least it&rsquo;ll do fine,&rdquo; said the
maid, with that Highland politeness that is often so bad for
business.&nbsp; &ldquo;There&rsquo;s not much about himself in
it, but och! it&rsquo;ll do fine.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s as nice a
letter as ever I saw: the lines are all that straight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there&rsquo;s blots,&rdquo; said Bud
regretfully.&nbsp; &ldquo;There oughtn&rsquo;t to be blots in a
real love-letter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Toots! just put a cross beside each of them, and write
&lsquo;this is a kiss,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Kate, who must have had
some previous experience.&nbsp; &ldquo;You forgot to ask him
how&rsquo;s his health, as it leaves us at present.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Bud completed the letter as instructed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now
for the envelope,&rdquo; said she.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll put the address on it myself,&rdquo; said
Kate, confused.&nbsp; &ldquo;He would be sure somebody else had
been reading it if the address was not in my hand of <a
name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
105</span>write,&rdquo;&mdash;an odd excuse, whose absurdity
escaped the child.&nbsp; So the maid put the letter in the bosom
of her Sunday gown against her heart, where meanwhile dwelt the
only Charles.&nbsp; It is, I sometimes think, where we should all
deposit and retain our love-letters; for the lad and lass, as we
must think of them, have no existence any more than poor
Kate&rsquo;s Charles.</p>
<p>Two days passed.&nbsp; Often in those two days would Bud come,
asking anxiously if there was any answer yet from Charles.&nbsp;
As often the maid of Colonsay reddened, and said with resignation
there was not so much as the scrape of a pen.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be on the sea,&rdquo; she explained at last,
&ldquo;and not near a post-office.&nbsp; Stop you till he gets
near a post-office, and you&rsquo;ll see the fine letter
I&rsquo;ll get.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know he was a sailor,&rdquo; said
Bud.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, I calculated he was a Highland chieftain
or a knight, or something like that.&nbsp; If I had known he was
a sailor I&rsquo;d have made that letter different.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;d have loaded it up to the nozzle with sloppy weather,
and said, Oh, how sad I was&mdash;that&rsquo;s you, Kate&mdash;to
lie awake nights thinking about him out on the heaving
billow.&nbsp; Is he a captain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Kate promptly.&nbsp; &ldquo;A full
captain in the summer time.&nbsp; In the winter he just stays at
home and helps on his mother&rsquo;s farm.&nbsp; Not a cheep to
your aunties about Charles, darling Lennox,&rdquo; she added
anxiously.&nbsp; &ldquo;They&rsquo;re&mdash;they&rsquo;re that
particular!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re a true love at
all,&rdquo; said Bud, reflecting on many interviews at the
kitchen window and the back-door.&nbsp; &ldquo;Just think of the
way you make goo-goo eyes at the letter-carrier, and the
butcher&rsquo;s man, and the ashpit gentleman.&nbsp; What would
Charles say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Toots! I&rsquo;m only putting by the time with
them,&rdquo; explained the maid.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only a
diversion.&nbsp; When I marry I will marry for my own
conveniency, and the man for me is Charles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the name of his ship?&rdquo; asked the
child.</p>
<p><a name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
106</span>&ldquo;The <i>Good Intent</i>,&rdquo; said Kate, who
had known a skiff of the name in Colonsay.&nbsp; &ldquo;A
beautiful ship, with two yellow lums, and flags to the
masthead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s fine and fancy!&rdquo; said Bud.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There was a gentleman who loved me to destruction, coming
over on the ship from New York, and loaded me with candy.&nbsp;
He was not the captain, but he had gold braid everywhere, and his
name was George Sibley Purser.&nbsp; He promised he would marry
me when I made a name for myself, but I &rsquo;spect Mister J. S.
Purser&rsquo;ll go away and forget.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just the way with them all,&rdquo; said
Kate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care, then,&rdquo; said Bud.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m all right; I&rsquo;m not kicking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Next day the breakfast in the house of Dyce was badly served,
for Kate was wild to read a letter that the post had brought, and
when she opened it, you may be sure Bud was at her shoulder.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dearest Kate</span> [it
said],&mdash;I love you truly and I am thinking of you most the
time.&nbsp; Thank God we was all safed.&nbsp; Now I will tell you
all about the Wreck.&nbsp; The sea was mountains high, and we had
a cargo of spise and perils from Java on the left-hand side the
map as you go to Australia.&nbsp; When the Pirite ship chased us
we went down with all hands.&nbsp; But we constrickted a raft and
sailed on and on till we had to draw lots who would drink the
blood.&nbsp; Just right there a sailor cried &lsquo;A sail, A
sail,&rsquo; and sure enough it was a sail.&nbsp; And now I will
tell you all about Naples.&nbsp; There is a monsterious mountain
there, or cone which belches horrid flames and lavar.&nbsp; Once
upon a time it belched all over a town by the name of Pompy and
it is there till this very day.&nbsp; The bay of naples is the
grandest in the world it is called the golden horn.&nbsp; Dearest
Katherine, I am often on the mast at night.&nbsp; It is cold and
shakey in that place and oh how the wind doth blow, but I <a
name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 107</span>ring a bell
and say alls well which makes the saloon people truly glad.&nbsp;
We had five stow-ways.&nbsp; One of them was a sweet fair-haired
child from Liverpool, he was drove from home.&nbsp; But a good
and beautious lady, one of the first new england families is
going to adopt him and make him her only air.&nbsp; How beautiful
and bright he stood as born to rule the storm.&nbsp; I weary for
your letters darling Katherine.&mdash;Write soon to your true
love till death,</p>
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;<span
class="smcap">Charles</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate struggled through this extraordinary epistle with
astonishment.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who in the world is it from?&rdquo;
she asked Bud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Charles, stupid,&rdquo; said Bud, astonished that there
should be any doubt about that point.&nbsp; &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t
I&mdash;didn&rsquo;t we write him the other night?&nbsp; It was
up to him to write back, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Kate, very conscious of that
letter still unposted, &ldquo;but&mdash;but he doesn&rsquo;t say
Charles anything, just Charles.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a daft-like
thing not to give his name; it might be anybody.&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s my Charles, and there&rsquo;s Charles Maclean from
Oronsay,&mdash;what way am I to know which of them it
is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be either or eyether,&rdquo; said
Bud.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you know Charles Maclean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I do,&rdquo; said the maid.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s following the sea, and we were well
acquaint.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he propose to you?&rdquo; asked Bud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he did not exactly propose,&rdquo; admitted Kate,
&ldquo;but we sometimes went a walk together to the churchyard on
a Sunday, and you know yourself what that means out in
Colonsay.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll just keep the letter and think of
it.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the nicest letter I ever got, and full of
information.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s Charles Maclean, I&rsquo;ll warrant
you, but he did not use to call me Katherine&mdash;he just said
Kate, and his face would be as red as anything.&nbsp; Fancy him
going down with all hands!&nbsp; My heart is sore for him,&rdquo;
and the maid there and then transferred her devotion from the <a
name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 108</span>misty lad
of her own imagination to Charles Maclean of Oronsay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll help me to write him a letter back
to-night,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed, I&rsquo;ll love to,&rdquo; said the child
wearily.&nbsp; But by the time the night came on, and Wanton
Wully rang his curfew bell, and the rooks came clanging home to
the tall trees of the forest, she was beyond all interest in life
or love.</p>
<h2><a name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
109</span>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Wanton Wully</span> only briefly rang the
morning bell, and gingerly, with tight-shut lips and deep nose
breathings, as if its loud alarm could so be mitigated.&nbsp;
Once before he had done it just as delicately&mdash;when the Earl
was dying, and the bell-ringer, uncertain of his skill to toll,
when the time came, with the right half-minute pauses, grieved
the town and horrified the Castle by a rehearsal in the middle of
a winter night.&nbsp; But no soul of mercy is in brazen bells
that hang aloof from man in lofty steeples, and this one, swung
ever so gently, sullenly boomed&mdash;boomed&mdash;boomed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, to the devil wi&rsquo; ye!&rdquo; said Wanton
Wully, sweating with vexation.&nbsp; &ldquo;Of all the senseless
bells!&nbsp; A big, boss bluiter!&nbsp; I canna compel nor coax
ye!&rdquo; and he gave the rope one vicious tug that brought it,
broken, round his ears; then went from the church into the sunny,
silent, morning street, where life and the day suspended.</p>
<p>In faith! a senseless bell, a merciless bell, waking folk to
toil and grief.&nbsp; Dr Brash and Ailie heavy-eyed, beside the
bed in the attic bower, shivered at the sound of it, and looked
with fear and yearning at the sleeping child.</p>
<p>Bud moved her head from side to side a little on the pillow,
with a murmur from her parched lips, and there was a flicker of
the eyelids&mdash;that was all.&nbsp; Between her and the
everlasting swound, where giddily swings the world and all its
living things, there seemed no more than a sheet of tissue-paper:
<a name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 110</span>it was
as if a breath of the tender morning air would quench the
wavering flame that once was joy and Lennox Dyce.&nbsp; The heart
of Auntie Ailie rose clamouring in her bosom; her eyes stung with
the brine of tears restrained, but she clenched her teeth that
she might still be worthy of the doctor&rsquo;s confidence.</p>
<p>He saw it, and put out his hand and pressed her shoulder, a
fat old-fashioned man, well up in years, with whiskers under his
chin like a cravat, yet beautiful as a prince to Ailie, for on
him all her hopes were cast.&nbsp; &ldquo;They call me
agnostic&mdash;atheist even, whiles, I hear,&rdquo; he had said
in the midst of their vigil; &ldquo;and, indeed, I&rsquo;m
sometimes beat to get my mind beyond the mechanism,
but&mdash;h&rsquo;m!&mdash;a fine child, a noble child; she was
made for something&mdash;h&rsquo;m!&nbsp; That mind and
talent&mdash;h&rsquo;m!&mdash;that
spirit&mdash;h&rsquo;m!&mdash;the base of it was surely never yon
grey stuff in the convolutions.&rdquo;&nbsp; And another time the
minister had come in (the folk in the street were furious to see
him do it!), and timidly suggested prayer.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Prayer!&rdquo; said Dr Brash, &ldquo;before this child,
and her quite conscious!&nbsp; Man, what in God&rsquo;s own name
are we doing here, this&mdash;h&rsquo;m!&mdash;dear good lady and
I, but fever ourselves with sleepless, silent prayer?&nbsp; Do
you think a proper prayer must be official?&nbsp; There&rsquo;s
not a drop of stuff in a druggist&rsquo;s bottle but what&rsquo;s
a solution of hope and faith
and&mdash;h&rsquo;m!&mdash;prayer.&nbsp; Con-found it,
sir!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He put out his hand and pressed her on the shoulder, and never
said a word.&nbsp; Oh, the doctors! the doctors!&nbsp; Hale men
and hearty, we can see their shortcomings and can smile at them,
but when the night-light burns among the phials!</p>
<p>It was the eighth day after Kate, with a face of clay, and her
sleeves rolled up, and the dough still on her elbows as she had
come from the baking-board, burst upon the doctor in his surgery
with the cry, &ldquo;Dr Brash, Dr Brash! ye&rsquo;re to haste ye
and come at once to the wee one!&rdquo;&nbsp; He had gone as
nearly on the wings of the wind as a fat man may in <a
name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
111</span>carpet-slippers, and found a distracted family round
the fevered child.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tut, tut, lassie,&rdquo; said he, chucking her lightly
under the chin.&nbsp; &ldquo;What new prank is this, to be
pretending illness?&nbsp; Or if it&rsquo;s not a let-on,
I&rsquo;ll be bound it&rsquo;s MacGlashan&rsquo;s almond
tablet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s these curs&egrave;d crab-apples in the
garden; I&rsquo;m sure it&rsquo;s the crab-apples, doctor,&rdquo;
said Miss Bell, looking ten years older than her usual.</p>
<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m! I think not,&rdquo; said Dr Brash more
gravely, with his finger on the pulse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s bound to be,&rdquo; said Bell, piteous at
having to give up her only hope.&nbsp; &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you
eat some yesterday, pet, after I told you that you were not for
your life to touch them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Bud, with hot and heavy breathing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why didn&rsquo;t ye, why didn&rsquo;t ye; and then
it might have been the apples?&rdquo; said poor Miss Bell.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t have minded me; I&rsquo;m aye so
domineering.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you&rsquo;re not,&rdquo; said Bud, and wanly
smiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed I am; the thing&rsquo;s acknowledged, and you
needn&rsquo;t deny it,&rdquo; said her auntie.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m desperate domineering to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m&mdash;I&rsquo;m not kicking,&rdquo;
said Bud.&nbsp; It was the last cheerful expression she gave
utterance to for many days.</p>
<p>Wanton Wully was not long the only one that morning in the
sunny street.&nbsp; Women came out, unusually early, as it
seemed, to beat their basses; but the first thing that they did
was to look at the front of Daniel Dyce&rsquo;s house with a kind
of terror lest none of the blinds should be up, and Mr
Dyce&rsquo;s old kid glove should be off the knocker.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Have you heard what way she is keeping to-day?&rdquo; they
asked the bell-man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a cheep!&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;I saw Kate
sweepin&rsquo; out her door-step, but I couldna ask her.&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s the curse of my occupation; I wish to goodness they
had another man for the grave-diggin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
112</span>&ldquo;You and your graves!&rdquo; said the
women.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who was mentioning them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stood on the syver-side and looked at the blank front of
Daniel Dyce&rsquo;s house with a gloomy eye.&nbsp; &ldquo;A
perfect caution!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s what she
was&mdash;a perfect caution!&nbsp; She called me Mr Wanton and
always asked me how was my legs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there anything wrong with your legs?&rdquo; said one
of the women.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whiles a weakness,&rdquo; said Wanton Wully, for he was
no hypocrite.&nbsp; &ldquo;Her uncle tellt me once it was a kind
o&rsquo; weakness that they keep on gantrys down in Maggie
White&rsquo;s.&nbsp; But she does not understand&mdash;the wee
one; quite the leddy! she thought it was a kind o&rsquo;
gout.&nbsp; Me! I never had the gout,&mdash;I never had the money
for it, more&rsquo;s the pity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He went disconsolate down the street to get his brush and
barrow, for he was, between the morning bell and breakfast-time,
the burgh&rsquo;s Cleansing Department.&nbsp; Later&mdash;till
the middle of the day&mdash;he was the Harbour-Master, wore a
red-collared coat and chased the gulls from the roofs of the
shipping-boxes and the boys from the slip-side where they might
fall in and drown themselves; his afternoons had half a dozen
distinct official cares, of which, in that wholesome air,
grave-digging came seldomest.&nbsp; This morning he swept
assiduously and long before the house of Daniel Dyce.&nbsp;
Workmen passing yawning to their tasks in wood and garden, field
and shed, looked at the muffled knocker and put the question;
their wives, making, a little later, a message to the well,
stopped too, put down their water-stoups, and speculated on the
state of things within.&nbsp; Smoke rose from more than one
chimney in the Dyces&rsquo; house.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the
parlour fire,&rdquo; said Wanton Wully.&nbsp; &ldquo;It means
breakfast.&nbsp; Cheery Dan, they say, aye makes a hearty
breakfast; I like to see the gift in a man mysel&rsquo;, though I
never had it; it&rsquo;s a good sign o&rsquo; him the night
before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Peter the post came clamping by-and-by along <a
name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 113</span>the street
with his letters, calling loudly up the closes, less willing than
usual to climb the long stairs, for he was in a hurry to reach
the Dyces&rsquo;.&nbsp; Not the window for him this morning, nor
had it been so for a week, since Kate no longer hung on the
sashes, having lost all interest in the outer world.&nbsp; He
went tiptoe through the flagged close to the back-door and
lightly tapped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What way is she this morning?&rdquo; said he, in the
husky whisper that was the best he could control his voice to,
and in his eagerness almost mastered his roving eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s got the turn!&mdash;she&rsquo;s got the
turn!&rdquo; said the maid, transported.&nbsp; &ldquo;Miss Dyce
was down the now and told me that her temper was
reduced.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord help us!&nbsp; I never knew she had one,&rdquo;
said the post.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no&rsquo; temper that I mean,&rdquo; said
Kate, &ldquo;but yon thing that you measure wi&rsquo; the
weather-glass the doctor&rsquo;s aye so cross wi&rsquo; that he
shakes and shakes and shakes at it.&nbsp; But anyway she&rsquo;s
better.&nbsp; I hope Miss Ailie will come down for a bite; if
not, she&rsquo;ll starve hersel&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s rare!&nbsp; By George, that&rsquo;s
tip-top!&rdquo; said the postman, so uplifted that he went off
with the M.C. step he used at Masons&rsquo; balls, and would have
clean forgotten to give Kate the letters if she had not cried him
back.</p>
<p>Wanton Wully sat on a barrow-tram waiting the postman&rsquo;s
exit.&nbsp; &ldquo;What way is she?&rdquo; said he, and
Peter&rsquo;s errant eye cocked to all airts of the
compass.&nbsp; What he wanted was to keep this tit-bit to
himself, to have the satisfaction of passing it along with his
letters.&nbsp; To give it to Wanton Wully at this stage would be
to throw away good fortune.&nbsp; It was said by Daniel Dyce that
the only way to keep a dead secret in the burgh was to send Wully
and his handbell round the town with it as public crier.&nbsp;
When Wanton Wully cried, it beat you to understand a word he said
after &ldquo;Notice!&rdquo; but unofficially he was marvellously
gleg at circulating news.&nbsp; &ldquo;What way <a
name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 114</span>is
she?&rdquo; he asked again, seeing the postman&rsquo;s
hesitation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If ye&rsquo;ll promise to stick to the head o&rsquo;
the toun and let me alone in the ither end, I&rsquo;ll tell
ye,&rdquo; said Peter, and it was so agreed.</p>
<p>But they had not long all the glory of the good tidings to
themselves.&nbsp; Dr Brash came out of Dyce&rsquo;s house for the
first time in two days, very sunken in the eyes and sorely
needing shaving, and it could be noticed by the dullest that he
had his jaunty walk and a flower in the lapel of his
badly-crushed coat.&nbsp; Ailie put it there with trembling
fingers; she could have kissed the man besides, if there had not
been the chance that he might think her only another silly
woman.&nbsp; Later Footles hurled himself in fury from the
doorway, his master close behind him.&nbsp; At the sight of Mr
Dyce the street was happy; it was the first time they had seen
him for a week.&nbsp; In burgh towns that are small enough we
have this compensation, that if we have to grieve in common over
many things, a good man&rsquo;s personal joy exalts us all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s better, Mr Dyce, I&rsquo;m hearing,&rdquo;
said P. &amp; A. MacGlashan, wiping his hands on his apron, to
prepare for a fervent clasp from one who, he ought to have known,
was not of the fervent-clasping kind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank God!&nbsp; Thank God!&rdquo; said Mr Dyce.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You would know she was pretty far through?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well&mdash;we kind of jaloused.&nbsp; But we kent there
was no danger&mdash;the thing would be ridiculous!&rdquo; said P.
&amp; A. MacGlashan, and went into his shop in a hurry, much
uplifted too, and picked out a big bunch of black grapes and sent
his boy with them, with his compliments, to Miss Lennox Dyce,
care of Daniel Dyce, Esquire, Writer.</p>
<p>Miss Minto so adored the man she could not show herself to him
in an hour like that; for she knew that she must weep, and a face
begrutten ill became her, so in she came from the door of her
Emporium and watched him pass the window.&nbsp; She saw in him <a
name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 115</span>what she
had never seen before&mdash;for in his clothing he was always
trim and tidy, quite perjink, as hereabouts we say: she saw, with
the sharp eyes of a woman who looks at the man she would like to
manage, that his hat was dusty and his boots not very brightly
polished.&nbsp; More than all the news that leaked that week from
the Dyces&rsquo; dwelling it realised for her the state of things
there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tcht! tcht! tcht!&rdquo; she said to herself;
&ldquo;three of them yonder, and he&rsquo;s quite
neglected!&rdquo;&nbsp; She went into a back room, where gathered
the stuff for her Great Annual Jumble Sales with ninepenny things
at sevenpence ha&rsquo;penny, and searched a drawer that
sometimes had revealed tremendous joy to Lennox and other bairns
who were privileged to see what they called &ldquo;Miss
Minto&rsquo;s back.&rdquo;&nbsp; In the drawer there was a doll
called Grace, a large, robust, and indestructible wooden child
that had shared Miss Minto&rsquo;s youth and found the years more
kindly than she, since it got no wrinkles thinking on the cares
of competition in the millinery and mantua-making trade, but
dozed its days away upon feathers and silk and velvet
swatches.&nbsp; Grace was dressed like a queen&mdash;if queens
are attired in gorgeous hand-stitched remnants; she had so long
been part of Miss Minto&rsquo;s life that the mantua-maker
swithered in her first intention.&nbsp; But she thought how happy
Mr Dyce must be that day, and hurriedly packed the doll in a box
and went round herself with it for Lennox Dyce.</p>
<p>As she knocked lightly at the front door, the old kid glove
came loose in her hand&mdash;an omen!&nbsp; One glance up and
down the street to see that no one noticed her, and then she
slipped it in her pocket, with a guilty countenance.&nbsp; She
was not young, at least she was not in her &rsquo;teens, but
young enough to do a thing like that for luck and her liking of
Daniel Dyce.&nbsp; Yet her courage failed her, and when Kate came
to the door the first thing she handed to her was the glove.</p>
<p><a name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
116</span>&ldquo;It fell off,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
hope it means that it&rsquo;s no longer needed.&nbsp; And this is
a little thing for Miss Lennox, Kate; you will give her it with
my compliments.&nbsp; I hear there&rsquo;s an
improvement?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wouldna <i>believe</i> it!&rdquo; said Kate.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Thank God, she&rsquo;ll soon be carrying-on as bad as
ever!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr Dyce would not have cared a rap that morning if he had come
upon his clerks at Catch-the-Ten, or even playing leapfrog on
their desks.&nbsp; He was humming a psalm you may guess at as he
looked at the documents heaped on his table&mdash;his calf-bound
books and the dark japanned deed-boxes round his room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything just the same, and business still going
on!&rdquo; he said to his clerk.&nbsp; &ldquo;Dear me! dear me!
what a desperate world!&nbsp; Do you know, I had the notion that
everything was stopped.&nbsp; No, when I think of it I oftener
fancied all this was a dream.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not Menzies <i>v.</i> Kilblane at any rate,&rdquo; said
the clerk, with his hand on a bulky Process, for he was a cheery
soul and knew the mind of Daniel Dyce.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I daresay not,&rdquo; said the lawyer.&nbsp;
&ldquo;That plea will last a while, I&rsquo;m thinking.&nbsp; And
all about a five-pound fence!&nbsp; Let you and me, Alexander,
thank our stars there are no sick bairns in the house of either
Menzies or Kilblane, for then they would understand how much
their silly fence mattered, and pity be on our canty wee
Table-of-Fees!&rdquo;&nbsp; He tossed over the papers with an
impatient hand.&nbsp; &ldquo;Trash!&rdquo; said he.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What frightful trash!&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t be bothered with
them&mdash;not to-day.&nbsp; They&rsquo;re no more to me than a
docken leaf.&nbsp; And last week they were almost
everything.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll have heard the child has got the
turn?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should think I did!&rdquo; said Alexander.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And no one better pleased to hear it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Alick.&nbsp; How&rsquo;s the
family?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine,&rdquo; said the clerk.</p>
<p><a name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
117</span>&ldquo;Let me think, now&mdash;seven, isn&rsquo;t
it?&nbsp; A big responsibility.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so bad as long&rsquo;s we have the health,&rdquo;
said Alexander.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; said Mr Dyce.&nbsp; &ldquo;All one
wants in this world is the health&mdash;and a little more
money.&nbsp; I was just thinking&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; He stopped
himself, hummed a bar of melody, and twinkled through his
spectacles.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have read Dickens?&rdquo;
said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was familiar with his works when I was young,&rdquo;
said Alexander, like a man confessing that in youth he played at
bools.&nbsp; &ldquo;They were not bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just so!&nbsp; Well, do you know there was an idea came
to my mind just now that&rsquo;s too clearly the consequence of
reading Dickens for a week back, so I&rsquo;ll hold my hand and
keep my project for another early occasion when it won&rsquo;t be
Dickens that&rsquo;s dictating.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He went early back that day, to relieve Ailie at her nursing,
as he pretended to himself, but really for his own delight in
looking at the life in eyes where yesterday was a cloud.&nbsp; A
new, fresh, wholesome air seemed to fill the house.&nbsp; Bud lay
on high pillows, with Miss Minto&rsquo;s Grace propped against
her knees, and the garret was full of the odour of flowers that
had come in a glorious bunch from the banker&rsquo;s
garden.&nbsp; Bell had grown miraculously young again, and from
between Ailie&rsquo;s eyebrows had disappeared the two black
lines that had come there when Dr Brash had dropped in her ear
the dreadful word pneumonia.&nbsp; But Dr Brash had beaten
it!&nbsp; Oh, if she only knew the way to knit a winter waistcoat
for him!</p>
<p>The child put out her hand to her uncle, and he kissed her on
the palm, frightful even yet of putting a lip to her cheek, lest
he should experience again the terror of the hot breath from that
consuming inward fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he briskly, &ldquo;how&rsquo;s our
health, your <a name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
118</span>ladyship?&nbsp; Losh bless me! what a fine, big, sonsy
baby you have gotten here; poor Alibel&rsquo;s nose will be out
of joint, I&rsquo;m thinking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hasn&rsquo;t got any,&rdquo; said Bud, still weakly, in
her new, thin, and unpractised voice, as she turned with a look
that showed no lessening affection for the old doll, badly
battered in the visage and wanting in the limbs, which lay beside
her on the pillow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blythmeat and breadberry,&rdquo; said Daniel
Dyce.&nbsp; &ldquo;In the house of Daniel Dyce!&nbsp; Bell and
Ailie, here&rsquo;s an example for you!&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
119</span>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Following</span> on stormy weeks had come
an Indian summer, when the world was blessed with Ailie&rsquo;s
idea of Arden weather, that keeps one wood for ever green and
glad with company, knows only the rumour of distant ice and rain,
and makes men, reading thereof by winter fires, smell fir and
feel the breeze on their naked necks and hunger for the old
abandoned bed among the brackens.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is better to
hear the lark sing than the mouse squeak,&rdquo; was the motto of
Daniel Dyce, and though the larks were absent, he would have the
little one in the garden long hours of the day.&nbsp; She beiked
there like a kitten in the sunlight till her wan cheek
bloomed.&nbsp; The robin sang among the apples&mdash;pensive a
bit for the ear of age, that knows the difference between the
voice of spring and autumn&mdash;sweet enough for youth that
happily does not have an ear for its gallant melancholy; the
starlings blew like a dust about the sky; over the garden
wall&mdash;the only one in the town that wanted broken
bottles&mdash;far-off hills raised up their heads to keek at the
little lassie, who saw from this that the world was big and
glorious as ever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My! ain&rsquo;t this fine and clean?&rdquo; said
Bud.&nbsp; &ldquo;Feels as if Aunt Bell had been up this morning
bright and early with a duster.&rdquo;&nbsp; She was enraptured
with the blaze of the nasturtiums, that Bell would aye declare
should be the flower of Scotland, for &ldquo;Indian cress here,
or Indian cress there,&rdquo; as she would say,
&ldquo;they&rsquo;re more like Scots than any flower I ken.&nbsp;
The poorer the soil the <a name="page120"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 120</span>better they thrive, and they come to
gold where all your fancy flowers would rot for the want of
nutriment.&nbsp; Nutriment! give them that in plenty and
you&rsquo;ll see a bonny display of green and no&rsquo; much
blossom.&nbsp; The thing&rsquo;s a parable&mdash;the worst you
can do with a Scotsman, if you want the best from him, &rsquo;s
to feed him ower rich.&nbsp; Look at Captain Consequence; never
the same since he was aboard&mdash;mulligatawny even-on in India;
a score of servant-men, and never a hand&rsquo;s-turn for
himself,&mdash;all the blossom from that kind of Indian cress is
on his nose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lands sake!&nbsp; I <i>am</i> glad I&rsquo;m not
dead,&rdquo; said Bud, with all her body tingling as she heard
the bees buzz in the nasturtium bells and watched the droll dog
Footles snap at the butterflies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a bad world, one way and the
other,&rdquo; said Miss Bell, knitting at her side; &ldquo;it
would have been a hantle worse if we had had the making
o&rsquo;t.&nbsp; But here we have no continuing city, and
yonder&mdash;if the Lord had willed&mdash;you would have gone
sweeping through the gates of the new Jerusalem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sweeping!&rdquo; said the child.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
can&rsquo;t sweep for keeps; Kate won&rsquo;t give me a chance to
learn.&nbsp; But anyhow I guess this is a good enough world for a
miserable sinner like me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr Dyce, who had carried her, chair and all, into the garden,
though she could have walked there, chuckled at this
confession.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dan,&rdquo; said Bell, &ldquo;think shame of
yourself!&nbsp; You make the child light-minded.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The last thing I would look for in women is
consistency,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and I daresay that&rsquo;s
the way I like them.&nbsp; What is it Ailie quotes from
Emerson?&nbsp; &lsquo;A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of
little minds,&rsquo;&mdash;that kind of goblin never scared a
woman in the dark yet.&nbsp; But surely you&rsquo;ll let me laugh
when I think of you chiding her gladness in life to-day, when I
mind of you last week so desperate throng among the
poultices.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m for none of your lawyer arguments,&rdquo;
said <a name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
121</span>Bell, trying in vain to gag herself with a knitting-pin
from one of the Shetland shawls she had been turning out for
years with the hope that some day she could keep one for
herself.&nbsp; &ldquo;It might have been that &lsquo;she pleased
God and was beloved of Him, so that, living among
sinners&rsquo;&mdash;among sinners, Dan,&mdash;&lsquo;she was
translated.&nbsp; Yea, speedily was she taken away, lest that
wickedness should alter her understanding, or deceit beguile her
soul.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I declare if I haven&rsquo;t forgot my
peppermints!&rdquo; said her brother, quizzing her, and clapping
his outside pockets.&nbsp; &ldquo;A consoling text!&nbsp; I have
no doubt at all you could prelect upon it most acceptably, but
confess that you are just as glad as me that there&rsquo;s the
like of Dr Brash.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like the Doc,&rdquo; the child broke in, with most of
this dispute beyond her; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s a real cuddley
man.&nbsp; Every time he rapped at my chest I wanted to cry
&lsquo;Come in.&rsquo;&nbsp; Say, isn&rsquo;t he slick with a
poultice!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was slick enough to save your life, my dear,&rdquo;
said Uncle Dan soberly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m almost jealous of
him now, for Bud&rsquo;s more his than mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he make me better?&rdquo; asked the child.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Under God.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m thinking we would have been
in a bonny habble wanting him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what a bonny habble is from
Adam,&rdquo; said Bud, &ldquo;but I bet the Doc wasn&rsquo;t
<i>everything</i>: there was that prayer, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh?&rdquo; exclaimed her uncle sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I heard you, Uncle Dan,&rdquo; said Bud, with a sly
look up at him.&nbsp; &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t sleeping really that
night, and I was awful liable to have tickled you on the bald bit
of your head.&nbsp; I never saw it before.&nbsp; I could have
done it easily if it wasn&rsquo;t that I was so tired; and my
breath was so sticky that I had to keep on yanking it, just; and
you were so solemn and used such dre&rsquo;ffle big words.&nbsp;
I didn&rsquo;t tickle you, but I thought I&rsquo;d help you pray,
and so I kept my eyes shut and said a bit myself.&nbsp; Say, I
want to tell you something,&rdquo;&mdash;she stammered, <a
name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 122</span>with a
shaking lip.&nbsp; &ldquo;I felt real mean when you talked about
a sinless child; of course you didn&rsquo;t know, but it
was&mdash;it wasn&rsquo;t true.&nbsp; I know why I was taken ill:
it was a punishment for telling fibs to Kate.&nbsp; I was mighty
frightened that I&rsquo;d die before I had a chance to tell
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fibs!&rdquo; said Mr Dyce seriously.&nbsp;
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s bad.&nbsp; And I&rsquo;m loth to think it of
you, for it&rsquo;s the only sin that does not run in the family,
and the one I most abominate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bell stopped her knitting, quite distressed, and the child
lost her new-come bloom.&nbsp; &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean it for
fibs,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and it wasn&rsquo;t anything I
said, but a thing I did when I was being Winifred Wallace.&nbsp;
Kate wanted me to write a letter&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who to?&rdquo; demanded Auntie Bell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was to&mdash;it was to&mdash;oh, I daren&rsquo;t
tell you,&rdquo; said Bud, distressed.&nbsp; &ldquo;It
wouldn&rsquo;t be fair, and maybe she&rsquo;ll tell you herself,
if you ask her.&nbsp; Anyhow I wrote the letter for her, and
seeing she wasn&rsquo;t getting any answer to it, and was just
looney for one, and I was mighty keen myself, I turned Winny on,
and wrote one.&nbsp; I went out and posted it that dre&rsquo;ffle
wet night you had the party, and I never let on to Kate, so she
took it for a really really letter from the person we sent the
other one to.&nbsp; I got soaked going to the post-office, and
that&rsquo;s where I guess God began to play <i>His</i>
hand.&nbsp; Jim said the Almighty held a royal flush every
blessed time; but that&rsquo;s card talk, I don&rsquo;t know what
it means, &rsquo;cept that Jim said it when the &lsquo;Span of
Life&rsquo; manager skipped with the boodle&mdash;lit out with
the cash, I mean, and the company had to walk home from Kalamazoo
on the railroad ties.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mercy on us!&nbsp; I never heard a word of it,&rdquo;
cried Miss Bell.&nbsp; &ldquo;This&rsquo;ll be a warning!&nbsp;
People that have bairns to manage shouldn&rsquo;t be giving
parties; it was the only night since ever you came here that we
never put you to your bed.&nbsp; Did Kate not change your clothes
when you came in wet?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
123</span>&ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t know I was out, for that would
have spoiled everything, &rsquo;cause she&rsquo;d have asked me
what I was doing out, and I&rsquo;d have had to tell her, for I
can&rsquo;t fib that kind of fib.&nbsp; When I came in all
soaking, I took a teeny-weeny loan of Uncle&rsquo;s tartan rug,
and played to Kate I was Helen Macgregor, and Kate went into
spasms, and didn&rsquo;t notice anything till my clothes were
dry.&nbsp; Was it very very naughty of me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was indeed!&nbsp; It was worse than naughty, it was
silly,&rdquo; said her Uncle Dan, remembering all the prank had
cost them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Lennox! my poor sinful bairn!&rdquo; said her aunt,
most melancholy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean the least harm,&rdquo; protested
the child, trembling on the verge of tears.&nbsp; &ldquo;I did it
all to make Kate feel kind of gay, for I hate to see a body
mope,&mdash;and I wanted a little fun myself,&rdquo; she added
hastily, determined to confess all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll Kate her, the wretch!&rdquo; cried Auntie
Bell quite furious, gathering up her knitting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Auntie Bell, it wasn&rsquo;t her fault, it
was&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But before she could say more, Miss Bell was flying to the
house for an explanation, Footles barking at her heels
astonished, for it was the first time he had seen her trot with a
ball of wool trailing behind her.&nbsp; The maid had the kitchen
window open to the last inch, and looked out on a street deserted
but for a ring of bairns that played before the baker&rsquo;s
door.&nbsp; Their voices, clear and sweet, and laden with no
sense of care or apprehension, filled the afternoon with
melody&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Water, water wall-flowers,<br />
Growing up so high,<br />
We are all maidens,<br />
And we must all die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To the maid of Colonsay in an autumn mood, the rhyme conveyed
some pensive sentiment that was pleasant though it almost made
her cry: the air <a name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
124</span>slipped to her heart, the words in some way found the
Gaelic chord that shakes in sympathy with minor keys, for
beautiful is all the world, our day of it so brief!&nbsp; Even
Miss Bell was calmed by the children&rsquo;s song as it came from
the sunny street into the low-ceiled shady kitchen.&nbsp; She had
played that game herself, sung these words long ago, never
thinking of their meaning: how pitiful it was that words and a
tune should so endure, unchanging, and all else alter!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kate, Kate, you foolish lass!&rdquo; she cried, and the
maid drew in with the old astonishment and remorse, as if it was
her first delinquency.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I was looking for the post,&rdquo; said
she.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not for the first time, it seems,&rdquo; said her
mistress.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry to hear it was some
business of yours that sent Miss Lennox to the post-office on a
wet night that was the whole cause of our tribulation.&nbsp; At
least you might have seen the wean was dried when she came
back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure and I don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re
talking about, me&rsquo;m,&rdquo; said the maid, astounded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You got a letter the day the bairn took ill; what was
it about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl burst into tears and covered her head with her
apron.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, Miss Dyce, Miss Dyce!&rdquo; she cried,
&ldquo;you&rsquo;re that particular, and I&rsquo;m ashamed to
tell you.&nbsp; It was only just diversion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, and you must tell me,&rdquo; said her mistress,
now determined.&nbsp; &ldquo;There&rsquo;s some mystery here that
must be cleared, as I&rsquo;m a living woman.&nbsp; Show me that
letter this instant!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t, Miss Dyce, I can&rsquo;t, I&rsquo;m
quite affronted.&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t ken who it&rsquo;s
from.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ken better than yourself; it&rsquo;s from nobody but
Lennox,&rdquo; said Miss Bell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My stars!&rdquo; cried the maid, astonished.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Do you tell me that?&nbsp; Amn&rsquo;t I the stupid
one?&nbsp; I thought it was from Charles.&nbsp; Oh, me&rsquo;m!
what will Charles Maclean of Oronsay think of me?&nbsp;
He&rsquo;ll think I was <a name="page125"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 125</span>demented,&rdquo; and turning to her
servant&rsquo;s chest she threw it open and produced the second
sham epistle.</p>
<p>Miss Bell went in with it to Ailie in the parlour, and they
read it together.&nbsp; Ailie laughed till the tears came at the
story it revealed.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s more creditable to her
imagination than to my teaching in grammar and spelling,&rdquo;
was her only criticism.&nbsp; &ldquo;The&mdash;the little
rogue!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And is that the way you look at it?&rdquo; asked Bell,
disgusted.&nbsp; &ldquo;A pack of lies from end to end.&nbsp; She
should be punished for it; at least she should be warned that it
was very wicked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stuff and nonsense,&rdquo; said Miss Ailie.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I think she has been punished enough already, if
punishment was in it.&nbsp; Just fancy if the Lord could make so
much ado about a little thing like that!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not a
pack of lies at all, Bell; it&rsquo;s literature, it&rsquo;s
romance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, romancing!&rdquo; said Miss Bell.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s romancing, if you leave out Walter
Scott?&nbsp; I am glad she has a conviction of the sin of it
herself.&nbsp; If she had slipped away from us on Wednesday this
letter would have been upon her soul.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s vexing her
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If that is so, it&rsquo;s time her mind was
relieved,&rdquo; said Ailie, and rising, sped to the garden with
the letter in her hand.&nbsp; Her heart bled to see the
apprehension on Bud&rsquo;s face, and beside her, Dan, stroking
her hair and altogether bewildered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bud,&rdquo; cried Ailie, kissing her, &ldquo;do you
think you could invent a lover for me who would write me letters
half so interesting as this?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a lover like that I
have all the time been waiting for: the ordinary kind, by all my
reading, must be very dull in their correspondence, and the lives
they lead deplorably humdrum&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, Charlie is my darling, my
darling, my darling;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh, Charlie is my darling, the young
marineer.&rsquo;</p>
<p>After this I&rsquo;ll encourage only sailors: Bud, dear, get
me a nice clean sailor.&nbsp; But I stipulate that he must <a
name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 126</span>be more
discriminating with his capitals, and know that the verb must
agree with its nominative, and not be quite so much confused in
his geography.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not angry with me, Aunt?&rdquo; said Bud,
in a tone of great relief, with the bloom coming back.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Was it very, very wicked?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pooh!&rdquo; said Ailie.&nbsp; &ldquo;If that&rsquo;s
wicked, where&rsquo;s our Mr Shakespeare?&nbsp; Oh, child! child!
you are my own heart&rsquo;s treasure.&nbsp; I thought a girl
called Alison I used to know long ago was long since dead and
done with, and here she&rsquo;s to the fore yet, daft as ever,
and her name is Lennox Dyce.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, it wasn&rsquo;t Lennox wrote that letter,&rdquo;
said Bud; &ldquo;it was Winifred Wallace, and oh, my! she&rsquo;s
a pretty tough proposition.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re quite,
<i>quite</i> sure it wasn&rsquo;t fibbing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No more than Cinderella&rsquo;s fibbing,&rdquo; said
her aunt, and flourished the letter in the face of Dan, who she
saw was going to enter some dissent.&nbsp; &ldquo;Behold, Dan
Dyce, the artist b-r-r-rain!&nbsp; Calls sailor sweethearts from
the vasty deep, and they come obedient to her bidding.&nbsp;
Spise and perils, Dan, and the golden horn a trifle out of its
latitude, and the darling boy that&rsquo;s <i>always</i> being
drove from home.&nbsp; One thing you overlooked in the boy,
Bud&mdash;the hectic flush.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m sure Kate would have
liked a touch of the hectic flush in him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Bud was still contrite, thinking of the servant.&nbsp;
&ldquo;She was so set upon a letter from her Charles,&rdquo; she
explained, &ldquo;and now she&rsquo;ll have to know that I was
joshing her.&nbsp; Perhaps I shouldn&rsquo;t say joshing, Auntie
Ailie,&mdash;I s&rsquo;pose it&rsquo;s slang.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is,&rdquo; said her aunt, &ldquo;and most
unladylike; let us call it pulling her le&mdash;let us call
it&mdash;oh, the English language!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll explain it
all to Kate, and that will be the end of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kate &rsquo;d be dre&rsquo;ffle rattled to talk about
love to a grown-up lady,&rdquo; said Bud, on thinking.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d best go in and explain it all myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
127</span>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Auntie Ailie; so Bud went
into the house and through the lobby to the kitchen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come to beg your pardon, Kate,&rdquo; said
she hurriedly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry
I&mdash;I&mdash;pulled your leg about that letter you thought was
from Charles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Toots!&nbsp; Ye needn&rsquo;t bother about my leg or
the letter either,&rdquo; said Kate, most cheerfully, with
another letter open in her hand, and Mr Dyce&rsquo;s evening mail
piled on the table before her; &ldquo;letters are like herring
now, they&rsquo;re comin&rsquo; in in shoals.&nbsp; I might have
kent yon one never came from Oronsay, for it hadn&rsquo;t the
smell of peats.&nbsp; I have a real one now that&rsquo;s new come
in from Charles, and it&rsquo;s just a beauty!&nbsp; He got his
leg broken on the boats a month ago, and Dr Macphee&rsquo;s
attending him.&nbsp; Oh, I&rsquo;m that glad to think that
Charles&rsquo;s leg is in the hands of a kent face!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why! that&rsquo;s funny,&rdquo; said Bud.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And we were just going to write&mdash;oh, you mean the
other Charles?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean Charles Maclean,&rdquo; said Kate, with some
confusion.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;was only lettin&rsquo;-on
about the other Charles; he was only a diversion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you sent him a letter?&rdquo; cried Bud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not me!&rdquo; said Kate composedly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
kept it, and I sent it on to Charles out in Oronsay when you were
poorly; it did fine!&nbsp; He says he&rsquo;s glad to hear about
my education, and doesn&rsquo;t think much of gentlemen that
dances, but that he&rsquo;s always glad to get the scrape of a
pen from me, because&mdash;because&mdash;well, just because he
loves me still the same, yours respectfully, Charles
Maclean.&nbsp; And oh, my stars, look at what a lot of
crosses!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bud scrutinised them with amazement.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,
<i>he&rsquo;s</i> a pansy!&rdquo; said she.</p>
<h2><a name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
128</span>CHAPTER XV.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Suddenly</span> all the town began to talk
of the pride of Kate MacNeill.&nbsp; She took to wearing all her
best on week-days; abandoned the kitchen window, and ruined an
old-established trade in pay-night sweeties, that used to shower
on her in threepenny packets at the start of every autumn when
the days grew short.&nbsp; No longer blate young lads scraped
with their feet uneasily in the sawdust of P. &amp; A
MacGlashan&rsquo;s, swithering between the genteel attractions of
Turkish Delight and the eloquence of conversation lozenges, that
saved a lot of thinking, and made the blatest equal with the
boldest when it came to tender badinage below the lamp at the
back-door close with Dyce&rsquo;s maid.&nbsp; Talk about the
repartee of salons! wit moves deliberately there compared with
the swift giff-gaff that Kate and her lads were used to maintain
with sentiments doubly sweet and ready-made at threepence the
quarter-pound.&nbsp; So fast the sweeties passed, like the thrust
and riposte of rapiers, that their final purpose was forgotten;
they were sweeties no longer to be eaten, but scented
billets-doux, laconic of course, but otherwise just as
satisfactory as those that high-born maidens get only one at a
time and at long intervals when their papas are out at
business.</p>
<p class="gutindent">&ldquo;Are you engaged?&rdquo;</p>
<p class="gutindent">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Just keep
spierin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="gutindent">&ldquo;Absence makes the heart grow
fonder.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="gutindent">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;You are a gay
deceiver.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="gutindent">&ldquo;My heart is yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="gutindent">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;How are your poor
feet?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 129</span>By
the hour could Kate sustain such sparkling flirtations, or at
least till a &ldquo;Kiss me, dearest&rdquo; turned up from the
bottom of the poke, and then she slapped his face for him.&nbsp;
It is the only answer out in Colonsay unless he&rsquo;s your
intended.</p>
<p>But it stopped all at once.&nbsp; P. &amp; A. was beat to
understand what way his pay-night drawings fell, until he saw
that all the lads were taking the other side of the street.&nbsp;
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s <i>her</i> off, anyway!&rdquo; said he to Mrs
P. &amp; A., with a gloomy visage.&nbsp; &ldquo;I wonder
who&rsquo;s the lucky man?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s maybe
Peter,&mdash;she&rsquo;ll no&rsquo; get mony losengers from
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And it was not only the decline in votive offerings that
showed the vital change; she was not at the Masons&rsquo; ball,
which shows how wrong was the thought of P. &amp; A., for Peter
was there with another lady.&nbsp; Very cheery, too; exceedingly
cheery, ah, desperately gay, but quite beyond the comprehension
of his partner, Jenny Shand, who was unable to fathom why a
spirit so merry in the hall should turn to groans and bitterness
when, feeling a faintish turn, she got him in behind the
draft-screen on the landing of the stair to sit the
&ldquo;Flowers o&rsquo; Edinburgh.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was fidging
fain to tell her plainly what he thought of all her sex, but
strove like a perfect gentleman against the inclination, and only
said &ldquo;Ha! ha! do you say so, noo?&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Weemen!&rdquo; with a voice that made them all out nothing
more nor less than vipers.&nbsp; Poor Jenny Shand! bonny Jenny
Shand! what a shame she should be bothered with so ill-faured a
fellow!&nbsp; When she was picking bits of nothing off his coat
lapel, as if he was her married man, and then coming to herself
with a pretty start and begging pardon for her liberty, the diffy
paid no heed; his mind was down the town, and he was seeing
himself yesterday morning at the first delivery getting the
window of Dyce&rsquo;s kitchen banged in his face when he started
to talk about soap, meaning to work the topic round to hands and
gloves.&nbsp; He had got the length of dirty <a
name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 130</span>hands, and
asked the size of hers, when bang! the window went, and the
Hielan&rsquo; one in among her pots and pans.</p>
<p>It was not any wonder, for other lads as deliberate and gawky
as himself had bothered her all the week with the same
demand.&nbsp; Hands! hands! you would think, said she, they were
all at the door wi&rsquo; a bunch of finger-rings bound to marry
her right or wrong, even if they had to put them on her
nose.&nbsp; Of course she knew finely what they were
after&mdash;she knew that each blate wooer wanted a partner for
the ball, and could only clench the compact with a pair of
gloves; but just at present she was not in trim for balls, and
landsmen had no interest for her since her heart was on the
brine.&nbsp; Some of them boldly guessed at seven-and-a-halfs
without inquiry, and were dumfoundered that she would not look at
them; and one had acquired a pair of roomy white cotton ones with
elastic round the top&mdash;a kind of glove that plays a solemn
part at burials, having come upon Miss Minto when her stock of
festive kids was done.&nbsp; They waylaid Kate coming with her
basket from the mangle&mdash;no, thanky, she was needing no
assistance; or she would find them scratching at the window after
dark; or hear them whistling, whistling, whistling&mdash;oh, so
softly!&mdash;in the close.&nbsp; There are women rich and nobly
born who think that they are fortunate, and yet, poor dears! they
never heard the whistling in the close.&nbsp; Kate&rsquo;s case
was terrible!&nbsp; By day, in her walks abroad in her new
merino, not standing so much as a wink, or paying any heed to a
&ldquo;Hey, Kate, what&rsquo;s your hurry?&rdquo; she would blast
them with a flashing eye.&nbsp; By night, hearing their signals,
she showed them what she thought of them by putting to the
shutters.&nbsp; &ldquo;Dir-r-rt!&rdquo; was what she called them,
with her nose held high and every &ldquo;r&rdquo; a rattle on the
lug for them&mdash;this to Bud, who could not understand the new
distaste Kate had to the other sex.&nbsp; &ldquo;Just dirt below
my feet!&nbsp; I think myself far far above them.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 131</span>One
evening Mr Dyce came in from his office and quizzed her in the
lobby.&nbsp; &ldquo;Kate,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not
complaining, but I wish you would have mercy on my
back-door.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s not a night I have come home of
late but if I look up the close I find a lad or two trying to
bite his way into you through the door.&nbsp; Can you no&rsquo;
go out, like a good lass, and talk at them in the Gaelic&mdash;it
would serve them right!&nbsp; If you don&rsquo;t, steps will have
to be taken with a strong hand, as you say yourself.&nbsp; What
are they wanting?&nbsp; Bless my soul! can this&mdash;can this be
love?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She ran to the sanctuary of the kitchen, plumped in a chair,
and was swept away in a storm of laughter and tears that
frightened Bud, who waited there a return of her aunts from the
Women&rsquo;s Guild.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, Kate, what&rsquo;s the
matter?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your un&mdash;your un&mdash;un&mdash;uncle&rsquo;s
blaming me for harbouring all them chaps about the door, and says
it&rsquo;s l-l&mdash;love: oh dear! I&rsquo;m black
affronted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t go into hysterics about a little
thing like that,&rdquo; said Bud; &ldquo;Uncle Dan&rsquo;s
tickled to death to see so many beaux you have, wanting you to
that ball; he said last night he had to walk between so many of
them waiting for you there in front, it was like shassaying up
the middle in the Haymakers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not hysterics, nor hersterics either,&rdquo;
said the maid; &ldquo;and oh, I wish I was out of here and back
in the isle of Colonsay!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes, Colonsay became a great place then.&nbsp; America, where
the prospects for domestics used to be so fascinating, had lost
its glamour since Bud had told her the servants there were as
discontented as in Scotland, and now her native isle beat
Paradise.&nbsp; She would talk by the hour, at a washing, of its
charms, of which the greatest seemed to be the absence of public
lamps and the way you heard the wind!&nbsp; Colonsay seemed to be
a place where folk were always happy, meeting in each
other&rsquo;s houses, <a name="page132"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 132</span>dancing, singing, courting,
marrying, getting money every now and then from sons or wealthy
cousins in Australia.&nbsp; Bud wondered if they never did any
work in Colonsay.&nbsp; Yes, yes, indeed! Kate could assure her,
they worked quite often out in Colonsay&mdash;in the winter
time.</p>
<p>But one thing greatly troubled her&mdash;she must write back
at once to the only Charles, who so marvellously had come to her
through Bud&rsquo;s unconscious offices, and she knew she could
never sustain the standard of hand-write, spelling, and
information Bud had established in her first epistle.&nbsp; Her
position was lamentable.&nbsp; It was all very well to be the
haughty madam on the street, and show herself a wise-like modest
gyurl, but what was that without the education?&nbsp; C. Maclean
was a man of education&mdash;he got it on the yats among the
gentry, he had travelled all the world!</p>
<p>Kate&rsquo;s new airs, that caused such speculation in the
town, were&mdash;now let me tell you&mdash;all the result of a
dash at education.&nbsp; She wanted to be able to write a letter
as good as Bud in a week or two, and had engaged the child to
tutor her.</p>
<p>Bud never found a more delicious game in all her life, and it
hurried her convalescence, for to play it properly she must be
Aunt Ailie, and Aunt Ailie was always so strong and well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Education,&rdquo; said Bud, who had a marvellous
memory, and was now, you will notice, Ailie Dyce, sitting on a
high chair, with the maid on a stool before
her,&mdash;&ldquo;education is not what a lot of sillies think it
is; it isn&rsquo;t knowing everything.&nbsp; Lots try for it that
way, and if they don&rsquo;t die young, just when they&rsquo;re
going to win the bursary, they grow up horrid bores, that nobody
asks to picnics.&nbsp; You can&rsquo;t know everything, not if
you sit up cramming till the cows come home; and if you want to
see a brainy person jump, ask him how his mother raised her
dough.&nbsp; Miss Katherine MacNeill, never&mdash;<span
class="GutSmall">NEVER</span>&mdash;NEVER be ashamed of not
knowing a thing, but <a name="page133"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 133</span>always be ashamed of not wanting to
know.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s Part One.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you think
you should have an exercise-book, child, and take it
down?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Toots! what&rsquo;s my head for?&rdquo; said the
servant</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uncle Dan says education is knowing what you
don&rsquo;t know, and knowing where to find it out without the
other people knowing; but he says in most places you can get the
name of having it fine and good by talking loud and pushing all
your goods in front of you in a big enough barrow.&nbsp; And
Auntie Bell&mdash;she says the fear of God is the beginning of
wisdom, and the rest of it is what she skipped at Barbara
Mushet&rsquo;s Seminary.&nbsp; But I tell you, child (said the
echo of Ailie Dyce), that education&rsquo;s just another name for
love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My stars!&nbsp; I never knew that before,&rdquo; cried
the servant; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m awful glad about
Charles!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t that kind of love,&rdquo; Bud hurriedly
explained, &ldquo;though it&rsquo;s good enough, for that&rsquo;s
too easy.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re only on the trail for education when
you love things so you&rsquo;ve simply <i>got</i> to learn as
much as is good for your health about them.&nbsp;
Everything&rsquo;s sweet&mdash;oh, so sweet&mdash;all the
different countries, and the different people, when you
understand, and the woods, and the things in them, and all the
animals,&mdash;&rsquo;cepting maybe puddocks, though it&rsquo;s
likely God made them too when He was kind of careless,&mdash;and
the stars, and the things men did, and
women,&mdash;&rsquo;specially those that&rsquo;s dead, poor
dears!&mdash;and all the books, &rsquo;cepting the stupid ones
Aunt Ailie simply <i>can&rsquo;t</i> stand, though she never lets
on to the ladies who like that kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My Lord! must you love them all?&rdquo; asked the maid,
astonished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you must, my Lord,&rdquo; said Bud.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll never know the least thing well in this world
unless you love it.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s sometimes mighty hard, I
allow.&nbsp; I hated the multiplication table, but now I love
it&mdash;at least, I kind of love it up to seven times nine, and
then it&rsquo;s almost horrid, but not so horrid as it <a
name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 134</span>was before
I knew that I would never have got to this place from Chicago
unless a lot of men had learned the table up as far as twelve
times twelve.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not particular about the multiplication
table,&rdquo; said the maid, &ldquo;but I want to be truly
refined, the same as you said in yon letter to Charles.&nbsp; I
know he&rsquo;ll be expecting it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;H-m-m-m-m!&rdquo; said Bud thoughtfully, &ldquo;I
s&rsquo;pose I&rsquo;ll have to ask Auntie Ailie about that, for
I declare to goodness I don&rsquo;t know where you get it, for
it&rsquo;s not in any of the books I&rsquo;ve seen.&nbsp; She
says it&rsquo;s the One Thing in a lady, and it grows inside you
someway, like&mdash;like&mdash;like your lungs, I guess.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s no use trying to stick it on outside with lessons on
the piano or the mandoline, and parlour talk about poetry, and
speaking mim as if you had a clothes-pin in your mouth, and
couldn&rsquo;t say the least wee thing funny without it was a bit
you&rsquo;d see in &lsquo;Life and Work.&rsquo;&nbsp; Refinement,
some folk think, is not laughing right out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My stars!&rdquo; said Kate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Auntie Bell says a lot think it&rsquo;s not knowing
any Scotch language and pretending you never took a tousy
tea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said Kate, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll never
mind refining; it&rsquo;s an awful bother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But every lady must be refined,&rdquo; said Bud.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Ailie prosists in that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care,&rdquo; said the maid;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not particular about being very much of a
lady,&mdash;I&rsquo;ll maybe never have the jewellery for
it,&mdash;but I would like to be a sort of lady on the Sundays,
when Charles is at home.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not hurryin&rsquo; you,
my dear, but&mdash;but when do we start the writin&rsquo;?&rdquo;
and she yawned in a way that said little for the interest of
Professor Bud&rsquo;s opening lecture.</p>
<p>Whereupon Bud explained that in a systematic course of
education reading came first, and the best reading was
Shakespeare, who was truly ennobling <a name="page135"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 135</span>to the human mind.&nbsp; She brought
in Auntie Ailie&rsquo;s Shakespeare, and sat upon the fender, and
plunged Kate at once into some queer society at Elsinore.&nbsp;
But, bless you! nothing came of it: Kate fell asleep, and woke to
find the fire cold and the child entranced with Hamlet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh dear! it&rsquo;s a slow job getting your
education,&rdquo; she said pitifully, &ldquo;and all this time
there&rsquo;s my dear Charles waiting for a letter!&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
136</span>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>
<p>&ldquo;I <span class="smcap">canna</span> be bothered with
that Shakespeare,&rdquo; Kate cried hopelessly, after many days
of him; &ldquo;the man&rsquo;s a mournin&rsquo; thing!&nbsp;
Could he not give us something cheery, with &lsquo;Come, all ye
boys!&rsquo; in it, the same as the trawlers sing in
Colonsay?&nbsp; There was far more fun last week in the penny
Horner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Bud dipped in the bottomless well of knowledge again and
scooped up Palgrave&rsquo;s &lsquo;Golden Treasury,&rsquo; and
splashed her favourite lyrics at the servant&rsquo;s feet.&nbsp;
Kate could not stand the &lsquo;Golden Treasury&rsquo; either;
the songs were nearly all so lamentable they would make a body
greet.&nbsp; Bud assured her on the best authority that the
sweetest songs were those that told of saddest thought, but Kate
said that might be right enough for gentry who had no real
troubles of their own, but they weren&rsquo;t the thing at all
for working folk.&nbsp; What working folk required were songs
with tunes to them, and choruses that you could tramp time to
with your feet.&nbsp; History, too, was as little to her taste;
it was all incredible,&mdash;the country could never have kept up
so many kings and queens.&nbsp; But she liked geography, for the
map enabled her to keep an eye on Charles as he went from port to
port, where letters in her name, but still the work of Lennox,
would be waiting for him.</p>
<p>The scheme of education was maintained so long because the
town had come upon its melancholy days and Bud began to feel
depression, so that playing teacher was her only joy.&nbsp; The
strangers <a name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
137</span>had gone south with the swallows; the steamer no longer
called each day to make the pavement noisy in the afternoon with
the skliff of city feet, so different from the customary tread of
tackety boots; the coachman&rsquo;s horn, departing, no longer
sounded down the valley like a brassy challenge from the wide,
wide world.&nbsp; Peace came to the burgh like a swoon, and all
its days were pensive.&nbsp; Folk went about their tasks
reluctant, the very smoke of the chimneys loitered lazily round
the ridges where the starlings chattered, and a haze was almost
ever over the hills.&nbsp; When it rose, sometimes, Bud, from her
attic window, could see the road that wound through the distant
glen.&nbsp; The road!&mdash;the road!&mdash;ah, that began to
have a meaning and a kind of cry, and wishfully she looked at it
and thought upon its other end, where the life she had left and
read about was loudly humming and marvellous things were being
done.&nbsp; Charles Maclean of Oronsay, second mate, whom she
loved unto destruction, now that he was writing regularly, fairly
daft himself to get such charming curious letters as he thought
from Kate, had been adjusted by the doctor, and was once again on
the heaving main.&nbsp; It would be Cardiff or Fleetwood,
Hamburg, Santander, or Bilbao, whose very name is like a story,
and his tarry pen, infected by the child&rsquo;s example, induced
to emulation, always bravely sought to give some picture of the
varied world through which he wandered.&nbsp; Of noisy ports did
he communicate, crowded with ships, of streets and lofty
warehouses, and places where men sang, and sometimes of the
playhouse, where the villain was a bad one and the women were so
braw.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is braw?&rdquo; asked Bud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fine clothes,&rdquo; said Kate; &ldquo;but
what&rsquo;s fine clothes if you are not pure in heart and have a
figure?&rdquo; and she surveyed with satisfaction her own plump
arms.</p>
<p>But the child guessed at a wider meaning for the word as
Charles used it, and thought upon the <a name="page138"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 138</span>beauteous clever women of the plays
that she had seen herself in far Chicago, and since her vicarious
lover would have thought them braw and plainly interesting, she
longed to emulate them, at least to see them again.&nbsp; And,
oh! to see the places that he wrote of, and hear the thundering
wheels and jangling bells!&nbsp; And there was also Auntie
Ailie&rsquo;s constant stimulus to thoughts and aspirations that
could meet no satisfaction in this little town.&nbsp; Bell dwelt
continually within the narrow walls of her immediate duty,
content, like many, thank the Lord! doing her daily turns as best
she could, dreaming of nothing nobler.&nbsp; Dan had ranged wider
in his time, and knew the world a great deal better, and had seen
so much of it was illusion, its prizes
&ldquo;Will-o&rsquo;-the-wisp,&rdquo; that now his wild geese
were come home.&nbsp; He could see the world in the looking-glass
in which he shaved, and there was much to be amused at.&nbsp; But
Ailie&rsquo;s geese were still flying far across the firmament,
knowing no place of rest.&nbsp; The child had bewitched her! it
was often the distant view for her now, the region unattainable;
and though apparently she had long ago surrendered to her
circumstances, she now would sometimes silently irk at her
prisoning here, in sleep-town, where we let things slide until
to-morrow, while the wild birds of her inclination flew around
the habitable wakeful world.&nbsp; Unwittingly&mdash;no, not
unwittingly always&mdash;she charged the child with curiosity
unsatisfiable, and secret discontent at little things and narrow,
with longings for spacious arenas and ecstatic crowded
hours.&nbsp; To be clever, to be brave and daring, to venture and
make a glorious name!&mdash;how her face would glow and all her
flesh would quiver picturing lives she would have liked to live
if only she had had the chance!&nbsp; How many women are like
that! silent by the hearth, seemingly placid and content as they
darn and mend and wait on the whim and call of dullards.</p>
<p>Bell might be content and busy with small affairs, but she had
a quick, shrewd eye, and saw the child&rsquo;s <a
name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
139</span>unrest.&nbsp; It brought her real distress, for so had
the roving spirit started in her brother William.&nbsp; Sometimes
she softly scolded Lennox, and even had contemplated turning her
into some other room from the attic that had the only window in
the house from which the highroad could be seen, but Ailie told
her that would be to make the road more interesting for the
child.&nbsp; &ldquo;And I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she added,
&ldquo;that it should worry us if she does indulge herself in
dreams about the great big world and its possibilities.&nbsp; I
suppose she&rsquo;ll have to take the road some day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take the road!&rdquo; cried Bell, almost weeping.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Are you daft, Ailie Dyce?&nbsp; What need she take the
road for?&nbsp; There&rsquo;s plenty to do here, and I&rsquo;m
sure she&rsquo;ll never be better off anywhere else.&nbsp; A lot
of nonsense!&nbsp; I hope you are not putting notions in her
head; we had plenty of trouble with her father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would break my heart to lose her, I assure
you,&rdquo; said Aunt Ailie softly; &ldquo;but&mdash;&rdquo; and
she ended with a sigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re content enough
yourself?&rdquo; said Bell; &ldquo;and you&rsquo;re not by any
means a diffy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed I am content,&rdquo; admitted Ailie; &ldquo;at
least&mdash;at least I&rsquo;m not complaining.&nbsp; But there
is a discontent that&rsquo;s almost holy, a roving mood
that&rsquo;s the salvation of the race.&nbsp; There were, you
mind, the Pilgrim Fathers&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish to the Lord they had bided at home!&rdquo; cried
Bell.&nbsp; &ldquo;There&rsquo;s never been happy homes in this
Christian land since they started emigration.&rdquo;&nbsp; And at
that Miss Ailie smiled and Dan began to chuckle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does it not occur to you, Bell,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;that but for the Pilgrim Fathers there would never have
been Bud?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I declare neither there would!&rdquo; she said,
smiling.&nbsp; &ldquo;Perhaps it was as well they went, poor
things!&nbsp; And, of course, there must be many an honest decent
body in America.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite a number!&rdquo; said Ailie.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
would not <a name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
140</span>expect this burgh to hold them all, or even Scotland:
America&rsquo;s glad to get the overflow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, you&rsquo;re trying to make me laugh, the pair of
you, and forget my argument,&rdquo; said Bell; &ldquo;but
I&rsquo;ll not be carried away this time.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m feared
for the bairn, and that&rsquo;s telling you.&nbsp; Oh, Ailie,
mind what her mother was&mdash;poor girl! poor dear girl!
playacting for her living, roving from place to place, with
nothing you could call a home; laughing and greeting and
posturing before lights for the diversion of the
world&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We might do worse than give the world diversion,&rdquo;
said Ailie soberly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes; but with a painted face and all a vain
profession&mdash;that is different, is it not?&nbsp; I love a
jovial heart like Dan&rsquo;s, but to make the body just a kind
of fiddle!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s only in the body we can be
ourselves&mdash;it is our only home; think of furnishing it with
shams, and lighting every room that should be private, and
leaving up the blinds that the world may look in at a penny
a-head!&nbsp; How often have I thought of William, weeping for a
living, as he had to do sometimes, no doubt, and wondered what
was left for him to do to ease his grief when Mary died.&nbsp;
Oh, curb the child, Ailie! curb the dear wee
lassie,&mdash;it&rsquo;s you it all depends on; she worships you;
the making of her &rsquo;s in your hands.&nbsp; Keep her
humble.&nbsp; Keep her from thinking of worldly glories.&nbsp;
Teach her to number her days, that she may apply her heart unto
wisdom.&nbsp; Her mind&rsquo;s too often out of here and
wandering elsewhere: it was so with William,&mdash;it was once
the same with you.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Indeed it was no wonder that Bud&rsquo;s mind should wander
elsewhere, since the life about her had grown so suddenly
dull.&nbsp; In these days Wanton Wully often let his morning
sleep too long possess him, and hurrying through the deserted
dawn with his breeches scarcely on, would ring the bell in a
hasty fury half an hour behind the proper time.&nbsp; But a
little lateness <a name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
141</span>did not matter in a town that really never woke.&nbsp;
Men went to work in what we call a dover&mdash;that is, half
asleep; shopkeepers came blinking drowsily down and took their
shutters off, and went back to breakfast, or, I fear sometimes,
to bed, and when the day was aired and decency demanded that they
should make some pretence at business, they stood by the hour at
their shop doors looking at the sparrows, wagtails, and
blue-bonnets pecking in the street, or at the gulls that
quarrelled in the syver sand.&nbsp; Nothing doing.&nbsp; Two or
three times a-day a cart from the country rumbled down the town,
breaking the Sabbath calm; and on one memorable afternoon there
came a dark Italian with an organ who must have thought that this
at last was Eldorado, so great was his reward from a community
sick of looking at each other.&nbsp; But otherwise nothing doing,
not a thing!&nbsp; As in the dark of the fabled underland the men
who are blind are kings, George Jordon, the silly man, who never
had a purpose, and carried about with him an enviable eternal
dream, seemed in that listless world the only wide-awake, for he
at least kept moving, slouching somewhere, sure there was work
for him to do if only he could get at it.&nbsp; Bairns dawdled to
the schools, dogs slept in the track where once was summer
traffic; Kate, melancholy, billowed from the kitchen window, and
into the street quite shamelessly sang sad old Gaelic songs which
Mr Dyce would say would have been excellent if only they were put
to music, and her voice was like a lullaby.</p>
<p>One day Bud saw great bands of countless birds depart, passing
above the highroad, and standing in the withering garden heard as
it were without a breath of wind the dry rattle of dead leaves
fall.&nbsp; It frightened her.&nbsp; She came quickly in to the
tea-table, almost at her tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s dre&rsquo;ffle,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Sunday all the time, without good clothes and
the gigot of mutton for dinner.&nbsp; I declare I want to
yell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear me!&rdquo; said Miss Bell cheerfully, &ldquo;I was
just <a name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
142</span>thinking things were unusually lively for the time of
year.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s something startling every other
day.&nbsp; Aggie Williams found her fine new kitchen-range too
big for the accommodation, and she has covered it with cretonne
and made it into a what-not for her parlour.&nbsp; Then
there&rsquo;s the cantata&mdash;I hear the U.P. choir is going to
start to practise it whenever Duncan Gill, next door to the hall,
is gone: he&rsquo;s near his end, poor body! they&rsquo;re
waiting on, but he says he could never die a Christian death if
he had to listen to them at their operatics through the
wall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a bit like this in Chicago,&rdquo; said
the child, and her uncle chuckled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I daresay not,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;What a pity
for Chicago!&nbsp; Are you wearying for Chicago,
lassie?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Bud, deliberating.&nbsp; &ldquo;It was
pretty smelly, but my! I wish to goodness folk here had a little
git-up-and-go to them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, I daresay it&rsquo;s not a bit like
Chicago,&rdquo; admitted Auntie Bell.&nbsp; &ldquo;It pleases
myself that it&rsquo;s just like Bonnie Scotland.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a bit like Scotland either,&rdquo; said
Bud.&nbsp; &ldquo;I calc&rsquo;lated Scotland &rsquo;d be like a
story-book all the time, chock-full of men-at-arms and
Covenanters, and things father used to talk about, Sundays, when
he was kind of mopish, and wanted to make me Scotch.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve searched the woods for Covenanters and can&rsquo;t
find one; they must have taken to the tall timber, and I
haven&rsquo;t seen any men-at-arms since I landed, &rsquo;cepting
the empty ones up in the castle lobby.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What <i>did</i> you think Scotland would be like,
dear?&rdquo; asked Ailie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Between me and Winifred Wallace, we figured it would be
a great place for chivalry and constant trouble among the crowned
heads.&nbsp; I expected there&rsquo;d be a lot of &lsquo;battles
long ago,&rsquo; same as in the Highland Reaper in the sweet,
sweet G.T.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s G.T.?&rdquo; asked Auntie Bell; and Bud
laughed slyly, and looked at her smiling Auntie <a
name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 143</span>Ailie, and
said: &ldquo;We know, Auntie Ailie, don&rsquo;t we?&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s GRAND!&nbsp; And if you want to know, Auntie Bell,
it&rsquo;s just Mister Lovely Palgrave&rsquo;s &lsquo;Golden
Treasury.&rsquo;&nbsp; <i>That&rsquo;s</i> a book, my Lord!&nbsp;
I expected there&rsquo;d be battles every day&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a bloodthirsty child!&rdquo; said Miss Ailie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean truly truly battles,&rdquo; Bud
hurried to explain, &ldquo;but the kind that&rsquo;s the same as
a sound of revelry off&mdash;no blood, but just a lot of
bang.&nbsp; But I s&rsquo;pose battles are gone out, like iron
suits.&nbsp; Then I thought there&rsquo;d be almost nothing but
cataracts and ravines and&mdash;and&mdash;mountain-passes, and
here and there a right smart Alick in short trunks and a feather
in his hat, winding a hunting-horn.&nbsp; I used to think, when I
was a little, wee, silly whitterick, that you wound a horn every
Saturday night with a key, just like a clock; but I&rsquo;ve
known for years and years it&rsquo;s just blowing.&nbsp; The way
father said, and from the things I read, I calc&rsquo;lated all
the folk in Scotland &rsquo;d hate each other like poison, and
start a clan, and go out chasing all the other clans with direful
slogans and bagpipes skirling wildly in the genial breeze.&nbsp;
And the place would be crowded with lovelorn maidens&mdash;that
kind with the starched millstones round their necks, like Queen
Mary always wore.&nbsp; My, it must have been rough on dear old
Mary when she fell asleep in church!&nbsp; But it&rsquo;s not a
bit like that; it&rsquo;s only like Scotland when I&rsquo;m in
bed, and the wind is loud, and I hear the geese.&nbsp; Then I
think of the trees all standing out in the dark and wet, and the
hills too, the way they&rsquo;ve done for years <i>and</i> years,
and the big lonely places with nobody in them, not a light even;
and I get the croodles and the creeps, for that&rsquo;s Scotland,
full of bogies.&nbsp; I think Scotland&rsquo;s
stone-dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no more dead than you are yourself,&rdquo;
said Miss Bell, determined ever to uphold her native land.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The cleverest people in the world come from
Scotland.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So father used to say; but Jim, he said he <a
name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 144</span>guessed the
cleverer they were the quicker they came.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not a
bit surprised they make a dash from home when they feel so dead
and mopish and think of things and see that road.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Road?&rdquo; said Uncle Dan.&nbsp; &ldquo;What
road?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My road,&rdquo; said the child.&nbsp; &ldquo;The one I
see from my window: oh, how it rises and rises and winds and
winds, and it just <i>shrieks</i> on you to come right along and
try.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try what?&rdquo; asked her uncle curiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dunno,&rdquo; said Bud, thinking hard; &ldquo;Auntie
Ailie knows, and I &rsquo;spect Auntie Bell knows too.&nbsp; I
can&rsquo;t tell what it is, but I fairly tickle to take a walk
along.&nbsp; Other times I feel I&rsquo;d be mighty afraid to go,
but Auntie Ailie says you should always do the things
you&rsquo;re afraid to do, for they&rsquo;re most always the only
things worth doing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr Dyce, scratching the ear of Footles, who begged at the side
of his chair, looked over the rims of his glasses and scrutinised
the child.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All roads,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;as you&rsquo;ll find
a little later, come to the same dead end, and most of us, though
we think we&rsquo;re picking our way, are all the time at the
mercy of the Schoolmaster, like Geordie Jordon.&nbsp; The only
thing that&rsquo;s plain in the present issue is that we&rsquo;re
not brisk enough here for Young America.&nbsp; What do you think
we should do to make things lively?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hustle,&rdquo; said Bud.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, nobody here
moves faster&rsquo;n a funeral, and they ought to gallop if they
want to keep up with the band.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not in a hurry myself,&rdquo; said her uncle,
smiling.&nbsp; &ldquo;Maybe that&rsquo;s because I think
I&rsquo;m all the band there is, myself.&nbsp; But if you want to
introduce the Chicago system you should start with Mrs
Wright&rsquo;s Italian warehouse down the street,&mdash;the poor
body&rsquo;s losing money trying to run her shop on philanthropic
principles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bud thought hard a while.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Phil&mdash;phil&mdash;What&rsquo;s a philanthropic
principle?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p><a name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
145</span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a principle on which you don&rsquo;t
expect much interest except in another world,&rdquo; said her
uncle.&nbsp; &ldquo;The widow&rsquo;s what they call a Pilgrim,
hereabouts; if the meek were to inherit the earth in a literal
sense, she would long ago have owned the whole county.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A truly Christian woman!&rdquo; said Miss Bell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not denying it,&rdquo; said Mr Dyce;
&ldquo;but even a Christian woman should think sometimes of the
claims of her creditors, and between ourselves it takes me all my
time to keep the wholesale merchants from hauling her to
court.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you manage it?&rdquo; asked Ailie, with a
twinkle in her eyes; but Dan made no reply,&mdash;he coughed and
cleaned his spectacles.</p>

146</span>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">There</span> was joy a few days later in
the Dyce&rsquo;s kitchen when Peter the postman, with a snort
that showed the bitterness of his feelings, passed through the
window a parcel for Kate, that on the face of it had come from
foreign parts.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t ken who it&rsquo;s
from, and ye&rsquo;re no&rsquo; to think I&rsquo;m
askin&rsquo;,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;but the stamps alone for
that thing must have cost a bonny penny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did they, indeed!&rdquo; said Kate, with a toss of her
head.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ye&rsquo;ll be glad to ken he can well afford
it!&rdquo; and she sniffed at the parcel, redolent of perfumes
strange and strong.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye needna snap the nose off me,&rdquo; said the
postman, &ldquo;I only made the remark.&nbsp; What&mdash;what
does the fellow do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a traveller for railway tunnels,&rdquo;
retorted the maid of Colonsay, and shut the window with a bang,
to tear open the parcel in a frenzy of expectation, and find a
bottle of Genuine Riga Balsam&mdash;wonderful cure for
sailors&rsquo; wounds!&mdash;another of Florida Water, and a
silver locket, with a note from Charles saying the poem she had
sent was truly grand, and wishing her many happy returns of the
day.&nbsp; Like many of Charles&rsquo;s letters now, its meaning
was, in parts, beyond her, until she could learn from Bud the
nature of the one to which it was an answer,&mdash;for Bud was so
far enraptured with the wandering sailor that she sometimes sent
him letters which the servant never saw.&nbsp; That day the
breakfast service smelt of Florida Water, for Kate had <a
name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 147</span>drenched
herself with the perfume, and Miss Bell was sure she had washed
the dishes again with scented soap, as was the habit of the girl
when first she came from Colonsay, and thought that nothing but
Brown Windsor would do justice to Grandma Buntain&rsquo;s tea-set
used on Sundays.&nbsp; But Bud could see the signs of Shipping
Intelligence, and, as soon as she could, she hastened to the
kitchen, for it was Saturday, and on Saturdays there were no
lessons in the Dyce Academy.&nbsp; Oh! how she and Kate fondled
the bottles lovingly, and sniffed passionately at their contents,
and took turn about of the locket!&nbsp; The maid had but one
regret, that she had no immediate use for Riga Balsam; but Bud
was more devoted than that&mdash;she gently pricked the palm of
her hand with a pin and applied the Genuine.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh! how
he must love me&mdash;us, I mean,&rdquo; she exclaimed, and
eagerly devoured his letter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you say to him in the last?&rdquo; asked
Kate.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;s talking there about a poetry, and
happy returns of the day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bud confessed she had made a poem for him from his beloved
Kate, and had reckoned on fetching a gift of candy by telling him
her birthday was on Monday.&nbsp; &ldquo;But really I&rsquo;d
just as lief have the balsam,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
perfectly lovely; how it nips!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not my birthday at all,&rdquo; said
Kate.&nbsp; &ldquo;My birthday&rsquo;s always on the second
Sunday in September.&nbsp; I was born about the same time as Lady
Anne&mdash;either a fortnight before or a fortnight after; I
forget mysel&rsquo; completely which it was, and I daresay so
does she.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but Monday&rsquo;s my birthday, right
enough,&rdquo; said Bud, &ldquo;and seeing that we&rsquo;re sort
of loving him in company, I s&rsquo;posed it would be all the
same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it is, I&rsquo;m not complainin&rsquo;,&rdquo; said
the maid.&nbsp; &ldquo;And now we&rsquo;ll have to send him
something back.&nbsp; What would you recommend?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They considered many gifts appropriate for a
sailor,&mdash;sou&rsquo;-westers, Bible-markers, <a
name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 148</span>woollen
comforters, and paper-knives, scarf-pins, gloves, and ties.&nbsp;
Bud was sure that nothing would delight him like a book about a
desert island, but Kate said no, a pipe was just the very
ticket&mdash;a wooden pipe with silver mountings; the very one to
suit was in the window of Mrs Wright&rsquo;s Italian
warehouse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s an Italian warehouse?&rdquo; asked the
child.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have me there!&rdquo; said Kate, &ldquo;unless,
maybe, her husband was Italian before he went and died on
her.&nbsp; &lsquo;Italian Warehouse&rsquo; is the only thing
that&rsquo;s on her sign.&nbsp; She sells a thing for almost any
price you like to offer, because the Bible says it&rsquo;s not
the thing at all to argy-bargy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>I</i> know,&rdquo; said Bud; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s what
we call running a business on&mdash;on&mdash;on philanthropic
principles.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d love to see a body do it.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll run out and buy the pipe from Mrs Wright,
Kate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She departed on her errand down the town, at the other side of
the church; and the hours of the forenoon passed, and dinner-time
was almost come, and still there was no sign of her
returning.&nbsp; Kate would have lost her patience and gone to
seek for her, but found so much to interest at the window that
she quite forgot her messenger.&nbsp; Something out of the
ordinary was happening on the other side of the church.&nbsp;
Wanton Wully knew what it was, but of course he was not telling,
for he was out as public crier, rousing the town with his
hand-bell, and shouting &ldquo;Notice!&rdquo; with an air that
promised some tremendous tidings; but beyond mysterious words
like &ldquo;bed-rock prices,&rdquo; which he mumbled from a paper
in his hand, there was nothing to show this proclamation differed
from the common ones regarding herring at the quay or a sale of
delf down-by at John Turner&rsquo;s corner.&nbsp; &ldquo;What are
ye crying?&rdquo; they asked him, but being a man with the belief
that he had a voice as clear as a concert-singer, he would not
condescend to tell them.&nbsp; Only when some one looked across
his shoulder and read the paper for himself was it found that a
sale described as &ldquo;Revolutionary&rdquo; <a
name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 149</span>was taking
place at the Italian warehouse.&nbsp; Half the town at once went
to see what the decent body was up to.&nbsp; Kate saw them
hurrying down, and when they came back they were laughing.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the ploy?&rdquo; she asked a passer-by.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A sale at the Pilgrim weedow&rsquo;s,&rdquo; she was
told.&nbsp; &ldquo;She&rsquo;s put past her Spurgeon&rsquo;s
Sermons and got a book about business, and she&rsquo;s
learnin&rsquo; the way to keep an Italian warehoose in
Scotch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate would have been down the town at once to see this marvel
for herself, but her pot was on the boil, and here was the
mistress coming down the stair, crying &ldquo;Lennox,
Lennox!&rdquo;&nbsp; The maid&rsquo;s heart sank.&nbsp; She had
forgotten Lennox, and how could she explain her absence to a lady
so particular?&nbsp; But for the moment she was spared the
explanation, for the bark of Footles filled the street and Mr
Dyce came into the lobby, laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re very joco!&rdquo; said his sister, helping
him off with his coat.&nbsp; &ldquo;What are you laughing
at?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The drollest thing imaginable,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I have just left Captain Consequence in a terrible rage
about a letter that a boy has brought to him from Mrs
Wright.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s one of the folk that boast of paying as
they go but never make a start.&nbsp; It seems he&rsquo;s as much
in debt to her as to most of the other merchants in the place,
but wasn&rsquo;t losing any sleep about it, for she&rsquo;s such
a softy.&nbsp; This letter has given him a start.&nbsp; He showed
it to me, with the notion that it was a libel or a threat that
might be actionable, but I assured him I couldn&rsquo;t have
written one more to the point myself.&nbsp; It said that unless
he paid at once, something would be apt to happen that would
create him the utmost astonishment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mercy on us!&nbsp; That&rsquo;s not very like the
widow: she must be getting desperate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was the wording of the thing amused me,&rdquo; said
Mr Dyce, walking into the parlour, still chuckling,
&ldquo;&lsquo;something will be apt to happen that will create
you the utmost astonishment&rsquo;&mdash;it suggests such <a
name="page150"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 150</span>awful
possibilities.&nbsp; And it&rsquo;s going to serve it&rsquo;s
purpose too, for the Captain&rsquo;s off to pay her, sure it
means a scandal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate took the chance to rush round the kirk in search of her
messenger.&nbsp; &ldquo;This way for the big bargains!&rdquo;
cried some lads coming back from the Italian warehouse, or,
&ldquo;Hey! ye&rsquo;ve missed a step&rdquo;&mdash;which shows
how funny we can be in the smallest burgh towns; but Kate said
nothing, only &ldquo;trash!&rdquo; to herself in indignation, and
tried by holding in her breath to keep from getting red.</p>
<p>The shop of the Pilgrim widow suffered from its signboard,
that was &ldquo;far too big for its job, like the sweep that
stuck in my granny&rsquo;s chimney,&rdquo; as Mr Dyce said.&nbsp;
Once the sign had been P. &amp; A.&rsquo;s, but P. &amp;
A.&rsquo;s good lady tired of hearing her husband nicknamed the
Italian, and it went back to the painter, who partly paid with it
a debt to the Pilgrim widow, who long since rued her
acquisition.&nbsp; She felt in her soul it was a worldly
vanity,&mdash;that a signboard less obtrusive on the public eye
would more befit herself and her two meek little windows, where
fly-papers, fancy goods, sweetmeats, cigarettes, country eggs,
and cordial invitations to the Pilgrims Mission Bethel every
Friday (<i>D.</i> <i>V.</i>), eight o&rsquo;clock, kept each
other incongruous and dusty company.&nbsp; A decent pious widow,
but ah! so wanting any saving sense of guile.&nbsp; The Pilgrim
Mission was the thing she really lived for, and her shop was the
Cross she bore.&nbsp; But to-day it was scarcely recognisable:
the windows had been swept of their stale contents, and one was
filled with piles of rosy apples, the other with nuts that poured
in a tempting cataract from a cask upset with an air of reckless
prodigality.&nbsp; A large hand-lettered bill was in each window;
one said&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">HALLOWE&rsquo;EN!&nbsp; ARISE AND
SHINE!</p>
<p>and the other&mdash;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">DO IT NOW!</p>
<p><a name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 151</span>what
was to be done being left to the imagination.&nbsp; All forenoon
there had been a steady flow of customers, who came out of the
shop with more than nuts or apples, greatly amazed at the change
in the Pilgrim widow, who was cracking up her goods like any
common sinner.&nbsp; Behind the railed and curtained box in which
she was supposed to keep her books and pray for the whole
community, there seemed to be some secret stimulating influence,
for when bad payers tried to-day to get a thing on credit, and
she was on the point of yielding, she would dart into the box and
out again as hard as steel, insisting that at every Revolutionary
Sale the terms were cash.&nbsp; She was giving bargains, but at
her own price, never at her customers&rsquo;, as it used to
be.&nbsp; The Health Saline&mdash;extract of the finest fruit,
Cooling, Refreshing, Invigorating, Tonic (though indeed it looked
like an old friend from Rochelle with a dash of sugar and
tartaric)&mdash;was down a ha&rsquo;penny, to less than what it
cost, according to another hand-done bill upon the counter.&nbsp;
When they asked her how she could afford to sell the stuff below
its cost, she seemed ashamed and startled, till she had a moment
in behind the curtains, and then she told them it was all because
of the large turn-over; she could not afford to sell the saline
under cost if she did not sell it in tremendous quantities.</p>
<p>Did they want Ward&rsquo;s Matchless Polishing
Paste?&mdash;alas (after a dash behind the curtains) she was
completely out of it.&nbsp; Of late it had been in such great
demand that she got tired of ordering it every other week
wholesale.&nbsp; Yes, she was out of Ward&rsquo;s, but (again the
curtained box) what about this wonderful line in calf-foot jelly,
highly praised by the&mdash;by the connoisseurs?&nbsp; What were
connoisseurs?&nbsp; A connoisseur (again on reference behind the
curtains) was one of those wealthy men who could swallow
anything.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell ye what it is,&rdquo; said the tailor,
&ldquo;I see&rsquo;t at last!&nbsp; She&rsquo;s got a book in
there; I&rsquo;ve seen&rsquo;t <a name="page152"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 152</span>before&mdash;&lsquo;The Way to
Conduct a Retail Business&rsquo;&mdash;and when she runs behind,
it&rsquo;s to see what she should say to the customers.&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s where she got the notions for her windows and the
&lsquo;Do it Now!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But he was wrong&mdash;completely wrong, for when Kate came
into the shop with &ldquo;Have you seen Miss Lennox, Mrs
Wright?&nbsp; I sent her here a message hours ago,&rdquo; Lennox
herself came from the curtained box saying, &ldquo;Hello, Kate;
saw you first!&nbsp; What can we do for you to-day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My stars! my lady, you&rsquo;ll catch it!&rdquo; said
the maid.&nbsp; &ldquo;They&rsquo;re waiting yonder on you for
your dinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was just heading for home,&rdquo; said Bud, making
for the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My child! my child! my angel child!&rdquo; cried the
Pilgrim widow, going to kiss her, but Bud drew back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not to-day, please; I&rsquo;m miles too big for kissing
to-day,&rdquo; said she, and marched solemnly out of the Italian
warehouse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What in the world were you doing away so long?&rdquo;
asked Kate.&nbsp; &ldquo;Were you carrying on at
anything?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was paying for Charles&rsquo;s pipe,&rdquo; said the
child, returning the money she had got for its purchase.&nbsp;
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the sweetest lady, Mrs Wright, but my!
ain&rsquo;t she Baby Mine when it settles down to business?&nbsp;
When I wanted to buy the pipe, she was so tickled she wanted me
to have it for nothing, seeing I was Mr Dyce&rsquo;s niece.&nbsp;
She said Uncle Dan was a man of God who saved her more than once
from bankruptcy, and it was a pretty old pipe anyway, that had
been in the window since the time she got changed and dropped
brocaded dolmans.&nbsp; You&rsquo;d think it made her ache to
have folk come in her shop and spend money; I guess she was
raised for use in a free soup-kitchen.&nbsp; I said I&rsquo;d
take the pipe for nothing if she&rsquo;d throw in a little game
with it.&nbsp; &lsquo;What game?&rsquo; said she&mdash;oh,
she&rsquo;s a nice lady!&mdash;<a name="page153"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 153</span>and I said I was just dying to have
a try at keeping a really really shop, and would show her Chicago
way.&nbsp; <i>And you bet I did</i>, <i>Kate
MacNeill</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She came in with the soup, but no question was put till her
uncle asked the blessing, and then, before a spoon was lifted,
Auntie Bell said, &ldquo;Lassie, lassie, where in the world have
you been?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keeping shop for Mrs Wright,&rdquo; said Bud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tcht! tcht! you&rsquo;re beyond redemption,&rdquo;
cried her aunt.&nbsp; &ldquo;A child like you keeping
shop!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A bonny pair of shopkeepers, the widow and you!&nbsp;
Which of you counted the change?&rdquo; said Uncle Dan.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Tell us all about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I had the loveliest time,&rdquo; said Bud.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It would take till tea-time to tell just &rsquo;zactly
what a lovely day it was, but I&rsquo;ll hurry up and make it a
front scene.&nbsp; What you said, Uncle Dan, about her running a
shop on phil&mdash;on philanthropic principles made me keen to
see her doing it, and I went down a message for Kate, and offered
to help.&nbsp; She &rsquo;lowed herself she wasn&rsquo;t the best
there was in the land at keeping shop, and didn&rsquo;t seem to
make much money at it, but said thank the Lord she had the
priceless boon of health.&nbsp; I was the first customer
she&rsquo;d set eyes on all the morning, &rsquo;cept a man that
wanted change for half-a-crown and hadn&rsquo;t the half-crown
with him, but said he&rsquo;d pay it when he didn&rsquo;t see her
again, and she said she felt sure that trade was going to take a
turn.&nbsp; I said I thought it would turn quicker
if&mdash;if&mdash;if she gave it a push herself, and she said she
dared say there was something in it, and hoped I was in the
fold.&nbsp; I said I was, sure, and at that she cried out
&lsquo;Hallelujah!&rsquo;&nbsp; Every other way she was a
perfectly perfect lady; she made goo-goo eyes at me, and skipped
round doing anything I told her.&nbsp; First she cleared all the
old truck out of the windows, and filled them up with nuts and
apples for Hallowe&rsquo;en, till they looked the way windows
never looked in Scotland in all creation before, I
s&rsquo;pose.&nbsp; &lsquo;They&rsquo;ll think it kind of
daft,&rsquo; says she, <a name="page154"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 154</span>scared-like, &lsquo;they&rsquo;re
not like any other windows in the place.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Of
course not,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;and that&rsquo;s the very thing
to jar the eye of the passer-by.&rsquo;&nbsp; Jim Molyneux said a
shop-window was like a play-bill, it wanted a star line&mdash;a
feature&mdash;a whoop.&nbsp; Then I tried to think of the
&rsquo;cute things shopkeepers print in Chicago, but
couldn&rsquo;t remember any &rsquo;cepting &lsquo;Pants two
dollars a leg, seats free,&rsquo; but the widow said she
didn&rsquo;t sell pants.&nbsp; Then I thought of some natty
little cards I&rsquo;d seen that said &lsquo;Arise and
Shine!&rsquo; and &lsquo;Do it Now!&rsquo; so I got her to print
these words good and big, and put them in the window.&nbsp; She
wanted to know what they meant, but I said I couldn&rsquo;t tell
from Adam, but they would make the people wonder, and come in the
shop to find out, and then it would be up to her to sell them
something and pry the money out of them before they
baulked.&nbsp; Oh, Auntie, how I go on!&rdquo; and here Bud
stopped almost breathless and a little ashamed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on! go on!&rdquo; cried Ailie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I got behind a curtain into a little box-office,
where the widow kept a cash-book awfully doggy-eared, and a pile
of printed sermons, and heaps of tracts about doing to others as
you should be done by, and giving to the poor and lending to the
Lord.&nbsp; She read bits of them to me, and said she sometimes
wondered if Captain Brodie was too poor to pay for eighteen
months&rsquo; tobacco, but she didn&rsquo;t like to press him,
seeing he had been in India and fought his country&rsquo;s
battles.&nbsp; She said she felt she must write him again for her
money, but couldn&rsquo;t think of what to say that would be
Christian and polite and gentle, but still make him see she
wanted the money pretty bad.&nbsp; I said I would tell her what
to say that would suit just fine, and I dictated
it&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw the letter,&rdquo; said Uncle Dan, twinkling
through his glasses.&nbsp; &ldquo;It was a work of
genius,&mdash;go on! go on!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then folk began to come in for nuts and apples, <a
name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 155</span>and asked
what &lsquo;Arise and Shine&rsquo; and &lsquo;Do it Now&rsquo;
meant.&nbsp; She said they were messages from the angel of the
Lord&mdash;meaning me, I s&rsquo;pose,&mdash;though, goodness
knows, I&rsquo;m not much of an angel, am I, Auntie Bell?&nbsp;
Then the folk would fade away, looking a bit rattled, and come
back in a while and ask the price of things.&nbsp; She&rsquo;d
say she wasn&rsquo;t sure, but she thought about a shilling, or
maybe ninepence seeing they had a young family, and then
they&rsquo;d want the stuff on credit, and she&rsquo;d yammer
away to them till I got wild.&nbsp; When they were gone I had a
good heart-to-heart talk with her, and said
phil&mdash;philanthropic principles were a great mistake in a
small Italian warehouse, and that she ought to give the customers
a chance of doing unto others as they would be done by.&nbsp; She
made more goo-goo eyes at me, and said I was a caution, sure
enough, and perhaps I was right, for she had never looked at it
that way before.&nbsp; After that she spunked up wonderful.&nbsp;
I got her to send Mr Wanton through the town with his bell,
saying there was everything you wanted at Mrs Wright&rsquo;s at
bed-rock prices; and when people came in after that and wanted to
get things for nothing, or next to it, she&rsquo;d pop into the
box where I lay low, and ask me what she was to say next, and
then skip out to them as sharp as a tack and show they
needn&rsquo;t try to toy with her.&nbsp; She says she made more
money to-day by my playing shop Chicago-way than she&rsquo;d make
in a week her own way.&nbsp; Why, I&rsquo;m talking, and talking,
and talking, and my soup&rsquo;s stone-cold!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So&rsquo;s mine,&rdquo; said Uncle Dan, with a
start.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And mine!&rdquo; said Auntie Ailie, with a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And mine too, I declare!&rdquo; cried Miss Bell, with a
laugh they all joined in, till Footles raised his voice
protesting.</p>
<h2><a name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
156</span>CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Yes</span>, that was one bright day in the
dismal season, the day she tutored the Pilgrim widow in the newer
commerce.&nbsp; There was a happy night to follow soon, and it is
my grief that my pen cannot grasp the spirit of it, so that
reading you would laugh with her and whiles be eerie.&nbsp;
&rsquo;Tis true, there was little in the thing itself, as in most
that at the age of twelve impress us for all our lives, but it
met in some degree the expectations that her father&rsquo;s tales
of Scotland had sent home with her.&nbsp; Hitherto all had been
natural and wellnigh commonplace that she had experienced, all
except the folk so queer and kind and comical in a different way
from those in Chicago, the sounds she could hear as she lay in
her attic bed&mdash;the wind-call, and the honk of geese, and the
feeling of an island hopelessly remote from the new bright world
that best she knew,&mdash;remote and lost, a speck on the sea
far, far from great America.&nbsp; The last things vaguely
troubled her.&nbsp; For she was child enough as yet to shiver at
things not touched by daylight nor seemingly made plain by the
common-sense of man.&nbsp; She could laugh at the ghosts that
curdled the blood of the maid of Colonsay; and yet at times, by
an effort of the will, she could feel all Kate&rsquo;s terror at
some manifestation no more alarming than the cheep of mice or a
death-watch ticking in a corner cupboard.&nbsp; These were but
crude and vulgar fears, self-encouraged little actress
terrors.&nbsp; It took more than the hint of ghost or the menace
of the <a name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
157</span>ticking insect in the wood to wake in her the feeling
of worlds unrealised, encompassing, that she could get from
casual verses in her Auntie Ailie&rsquo;s book of Scottish
ballads, or find o&rsquo;erwhelm her of a sudden on looking from
her window into the garden bare and pallid below the moon.</p>
<p>This night there should be moon according to the penny
almanac, and Wanton Wully lit no lamps, but went home for a good
sleep to himself, as his saying went, and left the burgh to such
illumination as should come to it by the caprice of the
clouds.&nbsp; It lay, the little place, for most of the night in
darkness: a mirk so measureless deep, when the shops were shut,
that the red-lit skylight windows at the upper end of the town
seemed by some miracle to lift themselves and soar into the
heavens&mdash;square, monstrous flitting stars to the vision of
Bud, as she stood with Auntie Ailie at the door watching for
Uncle Dan&rsquo;s return from his office.&nbsp; To bring the
soaring windows back to their natural situation, she had to stand
a little way inside the lobby and establish their customary place
against the darkness by the lintel of the door.</p>
<p>From the other side of the church came a sound of dull
monotonous drumming&mdash;no cheerful rhythmic beat like the
drumming of John Taggart, but a mournful thumping, fitful in
flaws of the bland night wind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that, Auntie?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The guizards,&rdquo; said Miss Ailie, looking down upon
her in the lobby light with a smile she could not see.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Did you never hear of the guizards, Bud?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bud had never heard of the guizards; that was one thing,
surely, her father had forgotten.&nbsp; She had heard of
Hallowe&rsquo;en, she said, when further questioned.&nbsp;
Wasn&rsquo;t it the night for ducking into tubs for apples?&nbsp;
The Pilgrim widow had told her Hallowe&rsquo;en was coming, and
it was for Hallowe&rsquo;en she had sold so many nuts and apples;
but the widow said she felt ashamed to do it, for
Hallowe&rsquo;en was not approved of by the Mission, being
idolatrous and gay.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is it very gay?&rdquo; asked Bud
anxiously.</p>
<p><a name="page158"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
158</span>&ldquo;So I used to think it,&rdquo; said her aunt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I s&rsquo;pose it must be wicked,&rdquo; said the
child regretfully.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;d have expected
you&rsquo;d have Hallowe&rsquo;en night here in the house if it
hadn&rsquo;t been very bad.&nbsp; That widow did me a lot of
good, showing me what a heap of happy things are full of
sin.&nbsp; She knew them all!&nbsp; I s&rsquo;pose she got them
in the tracts.&nbsp; Yes, she did me a lot of good; I&mdash;I
almost wish I hadn&rsquo;t met that widow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you feel wicked when you&rsquo;re gay?&rdquo; asked
Miss Ailie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mercy on us! not a mite!&rdquo; said Bud.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I feel plumb full of goodness when I&rsquo;m gay; but
that&rsquo;s my youth and innocence.&nbsp; The widow says it is,
and I guess what she says goes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still, do you know, my dear, I&rsquo;d risk a little
gaiety now and then,&rdquo; said Auntie Ailie.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who
knows?&nbsp; The widow, though a worthy lady, is what in Scotland
we call an auld wife, and it&rsquo;s generally admitted that auld
wives of either sex have no monopoly of wisdom.&nbsp; If
you&rsquo;re wanting pious guidance, Bud, I don&rsquo;t know
where you&rsquo;ll get it better than from Auntie Bell; and she
fairly dotes on Hallowe&rsquo;en and the guizards.&nbsp;
By-and-by you&rsquo;ll see the guizards,
and&mdash;and&mdash;well, just wait and we&rsquo;ll find what
else is to be seen.&nbsp; I do wish your Uncle Dan would
hurry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The street was quite deserted, but did not show its vacancy
until the clouds for a moment drifted off the moon that rolled
behind the steeple.&nbsp; Then the long grey stretch of tenements
came out unreal and pale on the other side of the street, their
eaves and chimneys throwing inky shadows, their red-lit windows
growing of a sudden wan.&nbsp; Over them hung the ponderous kirk,
the master shadow, and all&mdash;the white-harled walls, the
orange windows, the glittering cold and empty street&mdash;seemed
like the vision of a dream.&nbsp; Then the clouds wrapped up the
moon again, and the black was the black of Erebus.&nbsp; But as
it fell, the dull drums seemed to come nearer, and from the head
of the street, the windy corner where <a name="page159"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 159</span>Uncle Dan had his office, small
moons came, purple and golden, fantastically carved.&nbsp; They
ran from house to house, and grouped in galaxies, or singly fell
apart, swinging and giddy orbs.&nbsp; For a moment Bud looked at
them bewildered, then gave a happy scream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The lanterns! the lanterns! look at the lanterns,
Auntie.&nbsp; Is that Hallowe&rsquo;en?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s part of it, at least,&rdquo; said her
Aunt.&nbsp; &ldquo;These are the guizards with their turnip
lanterns; they&rsquo;re going round the houses singing; by-and-by
we&rsquo;ll hear them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My! I wish to goodness I had a lantern like that.&nbsp;
To swing a lantern like that &rsquo;d feel like being a
lighthouse or the statue of Liberty at New York.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d
rather have a turnip lantern than a raft of dolls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you never have one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Bud sorrowfully.&nbsp; &ldquo;You have
no idea what a poor mean place Chicago is&mdash;not a thing but
common electric light!&rdquo; and Miss Ailie smiled gleefully to
herself again like one possessed of a lovely secret.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I wish that brother of mine would come quickly,&rdquo; she
said, and at the moment he came out of the darkness to them with
a comical look of embarrassment in his face and in his hand an
unlighted turnip lantern!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, Bud,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;take this, quickly,
before some silly body sees me with it and thinks it&rsquo;s for
myself.&nbsp; I have the name, I know, of being daft enough
already, and if it gets about the country that Daniel Dyce was
going round at Hallowe&rsquo;en with a turnip lantern, they would
think he had lost his head in a double sense and it would be very
bad for business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uncle!&rdquo; cried the child in ecstasy,
&ldquo;you&rsquo;re the loveliest, sweetest man in the whole wide
world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I daresay,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have been
much admired when I was younger.&nbsp; But in this case
don&rsquo;t blame me.&nbsp; I wash my hands of the
responsibility.&nbsp; I got my orders for that thing from your
Auntie Bell.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
160</span>&ldquo;My! ain&rsquo;t it cute?&nbsp; Did you make
it?&rdquo; asked Bud, surveying the rudely carved exterior with
delight, and her uncle, laughing, put on his glasses to look at
it himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;though I&rsquo;ve made a few
of them in my time.&nbsp; All that&rsquo;s needed is a knife or a
mussel-shell, and a dose of Gregory&rsquo;s Mixture in the
morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the Gregory&rsquo;s Mixture
for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In making a turnip lantern you eat the whole inside of
it,&rdquo; said Mr Dyce.&nbsp; &ldquo;Perhaps I might have made
this one myself if it wasn&rsquo;t that I know I would hate to
see the inside wasted, and still I have mind of the
Gregory.&nbsp; I bought the lantern from a boy at the head of the
street who was looking very gash and ill, and seemed suspiciously
glad to get quit of it.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m thinking that his
Gregory&rsquo;s nearly due.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bud hardly listened&mdash;she was so taken up with her
gift.&nbsp; She pounced at the handle of the kitchen door and
found it snibbed within.&nbsp; &ldquo;Kate! Kate!&rdquo; she
cried, &ldquo;let me in to light my lantern.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate was to be heard moving within, and there was a curious
sound of giggling, but no answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Open the door, quick, quick!&rdquo; cried Bud again;
and this time Auntie Bell, inside, said, &ldquo;Yes, open, Kate,
I think we&rsquo;re ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The door of the kitchen opened, and before the eyes of the
child was a spectacle the more amazing and delightful since all
day they had taken pains to keep the preparations secret.&nbsp; A
dozen children, who had been smuggled in by the back-door in the
close, were seated round a tub of water with floating apples, and
they were waiting her presence to begin their fun.</p>
<p>Oh, how happy was that hour!&nbsp; But not just then came the
thrill of which I&rsquo;m thinking.&nbsp; It was not the laughter
and the ducking in the tub, the discoveries of rings and buttons,
thimbles, and scuddy little dolls and silver pieces hidden in the
mound of champed potatoes Kate had cooked; nor <a
name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 161</span>the supper
that followed, nor the mating of nuts on the fire-ribs that gave
the eerie flavour of old time and the book of ballads.&nbsp; She
liked them all; her transport surely was completed when the
guizards entered black-faced, garmented as for a masque, each
thumping a sheepskin stretched on a barrel-hoop&mdash;the thing
we call a dallan.&nbsp; She had never discovered before what a
soul of gaiety was in Auntie Bell, demure so generally,
practising sobriety, it might seem, as if she realised her
daffing days were over and it was time for her to remember all
her years.&nbsp; To-night Miss Bell outdid even Ailie in her
merriment, led the games in the spacious kitchen, and said such
droll things, and kept the company in such a breeze that Ailie
cried at last, &ldquo;I think, Bell, that you&rsquo;re
fey!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, and I daresay you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo;
admitted Bell, sinking in a chair exhausted.&nbsp; &ldquo;At my
time of life it&rsquo;s daft; I have not laughed so much since I
was at Barbara Mushet&rsquo;s seminary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not these things, but the half-hour after, was what made the
evening memorable for the child.&nbsp; Nothing would satisfy her
but that she should light her lantern and convoy the other
children home, so Kate went with her, and the happy band went
through the street, each dropping off at her own house front till
the last was gone, and then Bud and the maid turned back.</p>
<p>But Kate had a project in her mind that had been there all
night since she had burned two nuts for herself and Charles in
the kitchen fire, and found them willing to flame quite snug
together.&nbsp; That so far, was satisfactory, but she wanted
more assurance of the final triumph of her love.&nbsp; There was,
it seemed, a skilful woman up the lane who knew spells and magic,
read tea-cups and the cards, and could unravel dreams.&nbsp;
Notably was she good at Hallowe&rsquo;en devices, and Bud must
come and see her, for it would not take a minute.</p>
<p>They found their way by the light of the lantern <a
name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 162</span>to the
spaewife&rsquo;s door, and to a poor confidant of fate and
fortune surely, since she had not found them kinder to herself,
for she dwelt in a hovel where foolish servant-girls came at
night with laughter and fears to discover what the future held
for them.&nbsp; Bud, standing on the floor in the circle of light
from her own lantern, watched the woman drop the white of an egg
in a glass of water.&nbsp; In the clot of the albumen, which
formed some wavering vague figures, she peered and found, she
said, the masts of ships and a crowded harbour, and that meant a
sailor husband.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was I not sure of it!&rdquo; cried Kate, triumphant;
but that was not the end of the ceremony, for she was bidden to
sip a little from the glass, without swallowing, and go dumb into
the night till she heard the Christian name of a man, and that
was the name of the sailor husband.&nbsp; Kate sipped from the
glass of destiny, and passed with Bud into the darkness of the
lane.&nbsp; It was then there came to the child the delicious
wild eerieness that she was beginning now to coax to her spirit
whenever she could, and feed her fancies on.&nbsp; The light of
the lantern only wanly illumined the lane they hurried through;
so plain and grey and ancient and dead looked the houses pressing
on either hand with windows shuttered, that it seemed to Bud she
had come by magic on a shell as empty of life as the armour in
the castle hall.&nbsp; By-and-by the servant, speechless, stopped
at a corner listening.&nbsp; No sound of human life for a moment,
but then a murmur of voices up the town, to which on an impulse
she started running with Lennox at her heels, less quickly since
the light of her lantern must be nursed from the wind.&nbsp; Bud
fell behind in the race for the voice of fate; the sound of the
footsteps before her died away in the distance, and her light
went out, and there she stood alone for the first time in the
dark of Scotland&mdash;Scotland where witches still wrought
spells!&nbsp; A terror that was sweet to think <a
name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 163</span>of in the
morning, whose memory she cherished all her days, seized on her,
and she knew that all the ballad book was true!&nbsp; One cry she
gave, that sounded shrilly up the street&mdash;it was the name of
Charles, and Kate, hearing it, gulped and came back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guessed that would fetch you,&rdquo; said Bud,
panting.&nbsp; &ldquo;I was so scared I had to say it, though I
s&rsquo;pose it means I&rsquo;ve lost him for a
husband.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My stars! you are the clever one!&rdquo; said the
grateful maid.</p>
<h2><a name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

<p><span class="smcap">Spring</span> came, and its quickening;
forest and shrub and flower felt the new sap rise; she grew in
the garden then, the child&mdash;in that old Scottish garden,
sheltered lownly in the neuk of the burgh walls.&nbsp; It must
have been because the Dyces loved so much their garden, and spent
so many hours there, that they were so sanely merry, nor let too
often or too long the Scots forebodings quell their spirits, but
got lessons of hope from the circling of the seasons, that give
us beauty and decay in an unvarying alternation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the time,&rdquo; used Ailie to say of the spring,
&ldquo;when a delicious feeling steals over you of wanting to sit
down and watch other people work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll need to have the lawn-mower sharpened; it
may be needed at any moment by the neighbours,&rdquo; said her
brother Dan.</p>
<p>They watched upspring the green spears of the daffodils, that
by-and-by should bear their flags of gold.</p>
<p>And Wanton Wully, when he was not bell-ringing or cleaning the
streets, or lounging on the quay to keep tally of ships that
never came, being at ports more propinque to the highways of the
world, where folks are making fortunes and losing much innocent
diversion, wrought&mdash;as he would call it&mdash;in the
Dyce&rsquo;s garden.&nbsp; Not a great gardener, admittedly, for
to be great in versatility is of necessity to miss perfection in
anything, so that the lowest wages in the markets of the world
are for the handy man.&nbsp; But being handy <a
name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 165</span>is its own
reward, carrying with it the soothing sense of self-sufficiency,
so we need not vex ourselves for Wully.&nbsp; As he said himself,
he &ldquo;did the turn&rdquo; for plain unornamental gardening,
though in truth he seemed to think he did it best when sitting on
his barrow trams, smoking a thoughtful pipe, and watching the
glad spring hours go by at a cost of sixpence each to the lawyer
who employed him.</p>
<p>Bud often joined him on the trams, and gravely listened to
him, thinking that a man who did so many different and
interesting things in a day was wise and gifted beyond
ordinary.&nbsp; In the old and abler years he had been a soldier,
and, nursing flowers nowadays, his mind would oft incongruously
dwell on scenes remote and terribly different, where he had
delved in foreign marl for the burial of fallen comrades.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me Inkermann again, Mr Wanton,&rdquo; Bud would
say, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll shoo off the birds from the
blub-flowers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do that, my dearie!&rdquo; he would answer,
filling another pipe, and glad of an excuse to rest from the
gentle toil of raking beds and chasing the birds that nipped the
tips from peeping tulip leaves.&nbsp; &ldquo;To the mischief with
them birds! the garden&rsquo;s fair polluted wi&rsquo;
them!&nbsp; God knows what&rsquo;s the use o&rsquo; them except
for chirping, chirping&mdash;&nbsp; Choo! off wi&rsquo; ye at
once or I&rsquo;ll be after ye!&mdash;&nbsp; Ay, ay,
Inkermann.&nbsp; It was a gey long day, I&rsquo;m tellin&rsquo;
ye, from a quarter past six till half-past four; slaughter,
slaughter a&rsquo; the time: me wi&rsquo; an awfu&rsquo; hacked
heel, and no&rsquo; a bit o&rsquo; anything in my stomach.&nbsp;
A nesty saft day, wi&rsquo; a smirr o&rsquo; rain.&nbsp; We were
as black as&mdash;as black as&mdash;as&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As black as the Earl o&rsquo; Hell&rsquo;s
waistcoat,&rdquo; Bud prompted him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Go on!&nbsp; I
mind the very words.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I only said that the once, when I lost the
place,&rdquo; said Wully, shocked at her glibness in the
uptake.&nbsp; &ldquo;And it&rsquo;s not a thing for the like
o&rsquo; you to say at all; it&rsquo;s only the word o&rsquo; a
rowdy sodger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, ain&rsquo;t I the limb!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll not say
it again,&rdquo; <a name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
166</span>promised the child; &ldquo;you needn&rsquo;t look as
solemn&rsquo;s the Last Trump; go on, go on!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As black as a ton o&rsquo; coal, wi&rsquo; the creesh
o&rsquo; the cartridges and the poother; it was the Minie gun, ye
ken.&nbsp; And the Rooshians would be just ower there between the
midden and the cold frame, and we would be coming down on
them&mdash;it micht be ower the sclates o&rsquo; Rodger&rsquo;s
hoose yonder.&nbsp; We were in the Heavy Diveesion, and I
kill&rsquo;t my first man that I kent o&rsquo; about where the
yellow crocus is.&nbsp; Puir sowl!&nbsp; I had nae ill-will to
the man, I&rsquo;ll guarantee ye that but we were baith unloaded
when we met each other, and it had to be him or me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused and firmed his mouth until the lips were lost among
the puckers gathered round them, a curious glint in his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on!&rdquo; cried Bud, sucking in her breath with a
horrid expectation; &ldquo;ye gie&rsquo;d him&mdash;ye
gie&rsquo;d him&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I gie&rsquo;d him&mdash;I tell&rsquo;t ye what I
gie&rsquo;d him before.&nbsp; Will I need to say&rsquo;t
again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Bud, &ldquo;for that&rsquo;s your top
note.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I gie&rsquo;d him&mdash;I gie&rsquo;d him the&mdash;the
<span class="GutSmall">BAGGONET</span>!&rdquo; cried the
gardener, with a sudden, frightful, furious flinging of the arms,
and then&mdash;oh, silly Wully Oliver!&mdash;began to weep, or at
least to show a tear.&nbsp; For Bud had taught him to think of
all that lay beyond that furious thrust of the bayonet&mdash;the
bright brave life extinguished, the mother rendered childless, or
the children fatherless, in some Russian home.</p>
<p>Bell, the thrifty woman, looking from the scullery window, and
seeing time sadly wasted at twelve bawbees the hour, would drop
the shawl she was making, and come out and send the child in to
her lessons, but still the orra gardener did not hurry to his
task, for he knew the way to keep Miss Dyce in an idle crack
although she would not sit on his barrow trams.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A wonderfu&rsquo; wean that!&rdquo; would be his
opening.&nbsp; &ldquo;A perfect caution!&nbsp; I can see a
difference on her <a name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
167</span>every day; she grows like a willow withy, and
she&rsquo;s losin&rsquo; yon awfu&rsquo; Yankee awcent she had
about her when she came at first.&nbsp; She can speak as bonny
English noo as you or me when she puts her mind
to&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid it would not be very difficult for her
to do that, Willy,&rdquo; said Miss Bell.&nbsp; &ldquo;She could
always speak in any way she wanted, and indeed the first time
that we heard her she was just yoursel&rsquo; on a New
Year&rsquo;s morning, even to the hiccough.&nbsp; I hope
you&rsquo;ll keep a watch on what you say to her; the bairn picks
up the things she hears so fast, and she&rsquo;s so innocent,
that it&rsquo;s hardly canny to let her listen much to the talk
of a man that&rsquo;s been a soldier&mdash;not that I blame the
soldiers, Willy, bless them all for Scotland, young or
old!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a word out of place from me, Miss Dyce,&rdquo;
would he cry, emphatic.&nbsp; &ldquo;Only once I lost the place
and slippit out a hell, and could have bit my tongue out for
it.&nbsp; We heard, ye ken, a lot o&rsquo; hells out yonder roond
aboot Sevastapol: it wasna Mr Meikle&rsquo;s Sunday-school.&nbsp;
But ye needna fear that Wully Oliver would learn ill language to
a lady like the wee one.&nbsp; Whatever I am that&rsquo;s silly
when the dram is in, I hope I&rsquo;m aye the perfect
gentleman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed I never doubted it,&rdquo; said Miss Bell.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But you know yourself we&rsquo;re anxious that she should
be all that&rsquo;s gentle, nice, and clean.&nbsp; When
you&rsquo;re done raking this bed&mdash;dear me! I&rsquo;m
keeping you from getting at it&mdash;it&rsquo;ll be time for you
to go home for dinner.&nbsp; Take a bundle of rhubarb for the
mistress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanky, thanky, me&rsquo;m,&rdquo; said Wanton Wully,
&ldquo;but to tell the truth we&rsquo;re kind o&rsquo; tired
o&rsquo; rhubarb; I&rsquo;m getting it by the stone from every
bit o&rsquo; grun&rsquo; I&rsquo;m labourin&rsquo; in.&nbsp; I
wish folk were so rife wi&rsquo; plooms or
strawberries.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bell smiled.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the herb of
kindness,&rdquo; said she.&nbsp; &ldquo;There&rsquo;s aye a
reason for everything in nature, and rhubarb&rsquo;s meant to
keep our generosity in practice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And there she would be&mdash;the foolish woman! <a
name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 168</span>keeping him
at the crack, the very thing he wanted, till Mr Dyce himself,
maybe, seeing his silver hours mishandled, would come to send his
sister in, and see that his gardener earned at least a little of
his wages.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A terrible man for the ladies, William!&nbsp; You must
have had a taking way with you when you were in the Army,&rdquo;
was all that the lawyer had to say.&nbsp; &ldquo;There was some
talk about doing a little to the garden, but, hoots man!
don&rsquo;t let it spoil your smoke!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was then you would see Wanton Wully busy.</p>
<p>Where would Bud be then?&nbsp; At her lessons? no, no, you may
be sure of it, but in with Kate of Colonsay giving the maid the
bloody tale of Inkermann.&nbsp; It was a far finer and more
moving story as it came from Bud than ever it was on the lips of
Wanton Wully.&nbsp; From him she only got the fling of the arms
that drove the bayonet home, the lips pursed up, as if they were
gathered by a string, the fire of the moment, and the broad Scots
tongue he spoke in.&nbsp; To what he gave she added fancy and the
drama.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&mdash;as black as a ton o&rsquo; coal wi&rsquo; the
creesh o&rsquo; the cartridges . . . either him or me . . . I
gie&rsquo;d him . . . I gie&rsquo;d him . . . I shut my eyes, and
said, &lsquo;O God, Thy pardon!&rsquo; and gie&rsquo;d him the
<span class="GutSmall">BAGGONET</span>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate&rsquo;s apron at that would fly up to cover her eyes, for
she saw before her all the bloody spectacle.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m that glad,&rdquo; she would say, &ldquo;that my
lad&rsquo;s a sailor.&nbsp; I couldna sleep one iota at night
thinkin&rsquo; of their baggonets if he was a
man-o&rsquo;-war.&nbsp; And that puts me in mind, my dear,
it&rsquo;s more than a week since we sent the chap a
letter.&nbsp; Have you time the now to sit and write a scrape to
Hamburg on the Elbow&mdash;imports iron ore?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And Bud had time, and sit she would and write a lovely letter
to Charles Maclean of Oronsay.&nbsp; She told him that her heart
was sore, but she must <a name="page169"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 169</span>confess that she had one time
plighted her troth to a Russian army officer, who died, alas! on
the bloody field.&nbsp; His last words, as his life-blood slowly
ebbed away, were&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What <i>would</i> be the last words of a Russian
officer who loved you?&rdquo; asked Bud, biting her pen in her
perplexity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Toots! anything&mdash;&lsquo;my best respects to
Kate,&rsquo;&rdquo; said the maid, who had learned by this time
that the letters Charles liked the most were the ones where Bud
most freely used imagination.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it would,&rdquo; said Bud.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It &rsquo;d sound far too calm for a man that&rsquo;s busy
dying;&rdquo; but she put it down all the same, feeling it was
only fair that Kate should have some say in the letters written
in her name.</p>
<p>That was the day they gave him a hint that a captain was
wanted on the yacht of Lady Anne.</p>
<p>And still Kate&rsquo;s education made some progress, as you
may see from what she knew of Hamburg, though she was not yet the
length of writing her own love-letters.&nbsp; She would sit at
times at night for hours quite docile, knitting in the kitchen,
listening to the reading of the child.&nbsp; A score of books had
been tried on her by Aunt Ailie&rsquo;s counsel (for she was in
the secret of this Lower Dyce Academy), but none there was that
hit the pupil&rsquo;s fancy half so much as her own old favourite
penny novelettes till they came one happy day to &lsquo;The
Pickwick Papers.&rsquo;&nbsp; Kate grew very fond of &lsquo;The
Pickwick Papers.&rsquo;&nbsp; The fun of them being in a language
quite unknown in Colonsay, was almost all beyond her.&nbsp; But
&ldquo;that poor Mr Puckwuck!&rdquo; she would cry at each
untoward accident; &ldquo;oh, the poor wee man!&rdquo; and the
folk were as real to her as if she had known them all in
Colonsay.&nbsp; If Dickens could have known the curious
sentiments his wandering hero roused in this Highland servant
mind, he would have greatly wondered.</p>
<p>While Bud was tutoring Kate that spring, Miss <a
name="page170"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 170</span>Bell was
thinking to take up the training of Bud herself in wiselike
housekeeping.&nbsp; The child grew as fast in her mind as in her
body: each day she seemed to drift farther away from the hearth
and into the world from which her auntie would preserve
her&mdash;into the world whose doors books widely opened, Auntie
Ailie&rsquo;s magic key of sympathy, and the genius of
herself.&nbsp; So Bell determined there and then to coax her into
the gentle arts of domesticity that ever had had a fascination
for herself.&nbsp; She went about it, oh, so cunningly! letting
Bud play at the making of beds and the dusting of the stair-rails
and the parlour beltings&mdash;the curly-wurly places, as she
called them, full of quirks and holes and corners that the
unelect like Kate of Colonsay will always treat perfunctorily in
a general wipe that only drives the dirt the farther in.&nbsp;
Bud missed not the tiniest corner nor the deepest nook: whatever
she did, she did fastidiously, much to the joy of her aunt, who
was sure it was a sign she was meant by the Lord for a proper
housewife.&nbsp; But the child soon tired of making beds and
dusting, as she did of white-seam sewing; and when Bell deplored
this falling off, Ailie said: &ldquo;You cannot expect everybody
to have the same gifts as yourself.&nbsp; Now that she has proved
she&rsquo;s fit to clean a railing properly, she&rsquo;s not so
much to blame if she loses interest in it.&nbsp; The
child&rsquo;s a genius, Bell, and to a person of her temperament
the thing that&rsquo;s easily done is apt to be contemptuous: the
glory&rsquo;s in the triumph over difficulties, in getting
on&mdash;getting on&mdash;getting on,&rdquo; and Ailie&rsquo;s
face grew warm with some internal fire.</p>
<p>At that speech Bell was silent.&nbsp; She thought it just
another of Ailie&rsquo;s haiverings; but Mr Dyce, who heard,
suddenly became grave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think it&rsquo;s genius or precocity?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re very much the same thing,&rdquo; said
Ailie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I could be the child I was; if I could just
remember&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; She stopped herself and smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What vanity!&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;what
conceit!&nbsp; If I <a name="page171"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 171</span>could be the child I was, I dare say
I would be pretty commonplace after all, and still have the same
old draigled pinnies; but I have a notion that Lennox was never
meant to make beds, dust stair-railings, or sit in a parlour
listening, demure, to gossip about the village pump and Sacrament
Sunday bonnets.&nbsp; To do these things is no discredit to the
women who are meant to do them, and who do them well; but we
cannot all be patient Marthas.&nbsp; I know, because I&rsquo;ve
honestly tried my best myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you say that, you&rsquo;re laughing at me, I
fear,&rdquo; said Bell, a little blamefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t thinking of you,&rdquo; said her sister,
vexed.&nbsp; &ldquo;And if I was, and had been laughing, I would
be laughing at the very things I love; it&rsquo;s only the other
things that make me solemn.&nbsp; Your way, Bell, was always
clear before you,&mdash;there you were the lucky woman; with
genius, as we have it in the child, the way&rsquo;s perplexed and
full of dangers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is she to be let drift her own way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We got her ten years too late to prevent it,&rdquo;
said Miss Ailie firmly, and looked at her brother Dan for some
assistance.&nbsp; He had Footles on his lap, stroking his tousy
back, and he listened with twinkling eyes to the argument,
humming the air of the day, that happened to be &ldquo;Robin
Tamson&rsquo;s Smiddy, O!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re both right and you&rsquo;re both wrong, as
Mr Cleland used to say if he was taking a dram with folk that had
an argument,&rdquo; said the lawyer.&nbsp; &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m
not so clever as Colin Cleland, for I can&rsquo;t ring the bell
and order in the <i>media sententia</i>.&nbsp; This I&rsquo;ll
say, that, to my mind, the child is lucky if she&rsquo;s
something short of genius.&nbsp; If I had had a son, my prayer
would always be that he should be off and on about the
ordinary.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s lonely on the mountain-top, and genius
generally seems to go with a poor stomach or a bad lung, and pays
an awful price for every ecstasy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shakespeare!&rdquo; suggested Miss Ailie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Robert Burns!&rdquo; cried Bell.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Except for <a name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
172</span>the lass and the glass and the ran-dan&mdash;&nbsp;
Poor misguided laddie! he was like the folk he lived among.&nbsp;
And there was Walter Scott, the best and noblest man God ever
gave to Scotland, he was never on the mountain-top except it was
to bring a lot of people with him there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr Dyce cleaned his glasses and chuckled.&nbsp;
&ldquo;H&rsquo;m,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I admit there are
exceptions.&nbsp; But please pass me my slippers, Bell: I fall
back on Colin Cleland,&mdash;you&rsquo;re both right and
you&rsquo;re both wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Bell was so put about at this that she went at once to
the kitchen to start her niece on a course of cookery.</p>
<h2><a name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
173</span>CHAPTER XX.</h2>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Katerin</span>!&rdquo; she said,
coming into the kitchen with a handful of paper cuttings, and,
hearing her, the maid&rsquo;s face blenched.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I declare I never broke an article the day!&rdquo; she
cried protestingly, well accustomed to that formal address when
there had been an accident among her crockery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t charging you,&rdquo; said her
mistress.&nbsp; &ldquo;Dear me! it must be an awful thing a
guilty conscience!&nbsp; I was thinking to give you&mdash;and
maybe Lennox, if she would not mind&mdash;a lesson or two in
cookery.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a needful thing in a house with
anything of a family.&nbsp; You know what men are!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine that!&rdquo; said Kate.&nbsp; &ldquo;They&rsquo;re
always thinking what they&rsquo;ll put in their intervals, the
greedy deevils! beg your pardon, but it&rsquo;s not a swear in
the Gaelic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s only one Devil in any language,
Kate,&rdquo; said Miss Bell.&nbsp; &ldquo;&lsquo;How art thou
fallen from Heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning!&rsquo;&nbsp;
And I am glad to think he is oftener on our foolish tongues than
in our hearts.&nbsp; I have always been going to give you a
cookery-book&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A cookery-book!&rdquo; cried the maid.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Many a time I saw one out in Colonsay: for the
minister&rsquo;s wife had one they called Meg Dods, that was
borrowed for every wedding.&nbsp; But it was never much use to
us, for it started everything with &lsquo;Take a clean
dish,&rsquo; or &lsquo;Mince a remains of chicken,&rsquo; and
neither of them was very handy out in the isle of
Colonsay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Bell laid out her cuttings on the dresser&mdash;<a
name="page174"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 174</span>a mighty
pile of recipes for soups and stews, puddings and cakes,
sweetmeats, and cordial wines that could be made deliciously from
elder and mulberry, if hereabouts we had such fruits to make them
with.&nbsp; She had been gathering these scraps for many years,
for the household column was her favourite part of the paper
after she was done with the bits that showed how Scotsmen up in
London were at the head of everything, or did some doughty deed
on the field of war.&nbsp; She hoarded her cuttings as a miser
hoards his notes, but never could find the rich sultana cake that
took nine eggs, when it was wanted, but only the plain one
costing about one-and-six.&nbsp; Sometimes Ailie would, in
mischief, offer to look through the packet for recipes rich and
rare that had been mentioned; they were certainly there (for Bell
had read them gloatingly aloud when she cut them out), but Bell
would never let her do it, always saying, &ldquo;Tuts! never
mind; Dan likes this one better, and the other may be very nice
in print but it&rsquo;s too rich to be wholesome, and it costs a
bonny penny.&nbsp; You can read in the papers any day
there&rsquo;s nothing better for the health than simple
dieting.&rdquo;&nbsp; So it was that Mr Dyce had some monotony in
his meals, but luckily was a man who never minded that, liking
simple old friends best in his bill-of-fare as in his boots and
coats and personal acquaintances.&nbsp; Sometimes he would quiz
her about her favourite literature, pretending a gourmet&rsquo;s
interest for her first attempt at something beyond the ordinary,
but never relished any the less her unvarying famous kale and
simple entremets, keeping his highest praise for her remarkable
breakfasts.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether you&rsquo;re
improving or whether I am getting used to it,&rdquo; he would
say, &ldquo;but that&rsquo;s fish! if you please, Miss
Bell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try another scone, Dan,&rdquo; she would urge, to hide
the confusion that his praise created.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
sure you&rsquo;re hungry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not hungry,&rdquo; would he reply, &ldquo;but,
thank Providence, I&rsquo;m greedy&mdash;pass the
plate.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 175</span>Bell
was busy at her cookery lesson, making her cuttings fill the part
of the book that was still to buy, doing all she could to make
Bud see how noble was a proper crimpy paste, though her lesson
was cunningly designed to look like one for Kate alone.&nbsp; Her
sleeves were rolled up, and the flour was flying, when a rat-tat
came to the door.&nbsp; They looked up from their entrancing
occupation, and there, in front, was the castle carriage!</p>
<p>Miss Bell made moan.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mercy on us!&nbsp;
That&rsquo;ll be Lady Anne, and Ailie out, and I cannot go to
speak to anybody, for I&rsquo;m such a ticket.&nbsp; Run to the
door, dear, and take her into the parlour, and keep her there
till I am ready.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t forget to say &lsquo;My
Lady,&rsquo;&mdash;No, don&rsquo;t say &lsquo;My Lady,&rsquo; for
the Dyces are of old, and as good as their neighbours, but say
&lsquo;Your Ladyship&rsquo;; not too often, but only now and
then, to let her see you know it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bud went to the door and let in Lady Anne, leading her
composedly to the parlour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aunt Ailie&rsquo;s out,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and
Aunt Bell is <i>such</i> a ticket.&nbsp; But she&rsquo;s coming
in a minute, your&mdash;your&mdash;your&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; Bud
paused for a second, a little put about.&nbsp; &ldquo;I forget
which it was I was to say.&nbsp; It was either &lsquo;Your
Ladyship&rsquo; or &lsquo;My Lady.&rsquo;&nbsp; You&rsquo;re not
my lady, really, and you&rsquo;re not your own, hardly, seeing
you&rsquo;re promised to Colonel George.&nbsp; Please tell me
which is right, Lady Anne.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who told you it was Colonel George, my dear?&rdquo;
asked Lady Anne, sitting down on the proffered chair and putting
her arms around the child.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s just the clash of the parish,&rdquo;
said my little Scot who once was Yankee.&nbsp; &ldquo;And
everybody&rsquo;s so glad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are they, indeed?&rdquo; said Lady Anne, blushing in
her pleasure.&nbsp; &ldquo;That is exceedingly kind of
them.&nbsp; I always thought our own people the nicest and
kindest in the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just it!&rdquo; said Bud cheerfully.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Everybody everywhere is just what one is oneself,&mdash;so
<a name="page176"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 176</span>Aunt
Ailie says; and I s&rsquo;pose it&rsquo;s because
you&rsquo;re&mdash;&nbsp; Oh! I was going to say something about
you, but I&rsquo;ll let you guess.&nbsp; What lovely
weather!&nbsp; I hope your papa is well?&nbsp; And Mr
Jones?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you; papa is very well indeed,&rdquo; said Lady
Anne.&nbsp; &ldquo;And Mr Jones&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; She hung upon
the name with some dubiety.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The coachman, you know,&rdquo; said Bud placidly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a perfectly lovely man: so fat and
smiley.&nbsp; He smiles so much his face is all in gathers.&nbsp;
So kind to his horses too, and waves his whip at me every time he
passes.&nbsp; Once he gave me a ride on the dickey: it was
gorgeous.&nbsp; Do you often get a ride on the dickey, Lady
Anne?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never!&rdquo; said Lady Anne, with a clever little
sigh.&nbsp; &ldquo;Many a time I have wished I could get one, but
they always kept me inside the carriage.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t seem
to have had much luck all my life till&mdash;till&mdash;till
lately.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did Mr Jones never take you on his knee and tell you
the story of the Welsh giants?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Lady Anne, solemnly shaking her
head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;re too big now.&nbsp; What a pity!&nbsp;
Seems to me there isn&rsquo;t such a much in being a big L Lady
after all.&nbsp; I thought you&rsquo;d have everything of the
very best.&nbsp; You have no idea what funny ideas we had in
America about dukes and lords and ladies in the old
country.&nbsp; Why, I expected I&rsquo;d be bound to hate them
when I got here, because they&rsquo;d be so proud and haughty and
tyrannical.&nbsp; But I don&rsquo;t hate them one little bit;
they don&rsquo;t do anybody any harm more&rsquo;n if they were
knockabout artistes.&nbsp; I suppose the Queen herself &rsquo;d
not crowd a body off the sidewalk if you met her there.&nbsp;
She&rsquo;d be just as apt to say &lsquo;What ho! little
girl.&nbsp; Pip! pip!&rsquo; and smile, for Auntie Bell is always
reading in the newspapers snappy little pars. about the nice
things the Royal family do, just the same as if they
weren&rsquo;t royal a bit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I sometimes see those touching domestic
incidents,&rdquo; said her ladyship.&nbsp; &ldquo;You mean such
<a name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 177</span>things
as the Prince helping the cripple boy to find his crutch?&nbsp;
They make me almost cry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t wet a lash, if I were you,&rdquo; said
Bud.&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just the Press: like as not
there&rsquo;s nothing behind it but the agent in
advance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Agent in advance?&rdquo; said Lady Anne, perplexed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s bound to boom the show somehow:
so Jim Molyneux said, and he knew most things, did
Jim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wicked Republican!&rdquo; cried her ladyship,
hugging the child the closer to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a Republican,&rdquo; protested Bud.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m truly Scotch, same as father was, and Auntie
Bell is&mdash;that&rsquo;s good enough for me.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d
just <i>love</i> to be a My Lady myself, it must be so nice
and&mdash;and fairy.&nbsp; Why! it&rsquo;s about the only fairy
thing left anywhere, I guess.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s nothing really
to it; it&rsquo;s not being richer nor powerfuller nor more
tyrannical than anybody else, but
it&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s&mdash;&nbsp; I dunno
&rsquo;zactly what it is, but it&rsquo;s
something&mdash;it&mdash;it&rsquo;s romantic, that&rsquo;s what
it is, to be a King, or a Duke, or a My Lady.&nbsp; The fun of it
is all inside you, like poetry.&nbsp; I hope, My Lady Anne, you
&rsquo;preciate your privileges!&nbsp; You must &rsquo;preciate
your privileges always, Auntie Bell says, and praise the Lord
without ceasing, and have a thankful heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I assure you I do,&rdquo; replied her ladyship.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; said Bud
encouragingly.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s simply splendid to be a
really Lady with a big L without having to play it to
yourself.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve been one as Winifred Wallace quite
often; with Auntie Ailie&rsquo;s fur jacket and picture-hat on
I&rsquo;d sit and sit, and feel so composed and grand in the
rocker, and let on it was Mr Jones&rsquo;s carriage, and bow
sweetly to Footles who&rsquo;d be a poor man passing to his work,
and mighty proud to have me notice him.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d be sort
of haughty, but not &rsquo;bominable haughty, &rsquo;cause Auntie
Bell says there&rsquo;s nothing beats a humble and a contrite
heart.&nbsp; But then you see something would happen to spoil
everything; Kate would laugh, or Auntie Bell would pop in and cry
&lsquo;Mercy on me, child, <a name="page178"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 178</span>play-acting again!&nbsp; Put away
that jacket instantly.&rsquo;&nbsp; Then I&rsquo;d know I was
only letting on to be a really Lady; but with you it&rsquo;s
different&mdash;all the time you&rsquo;re It.&nbsp; Auntie Bell
says so, and she knows everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It really looks as if she did,&rdquo; said her
ladyship, &ldquo;for I&rsquo;ve called to see her to-day about a
sailor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A sailor!&rdquo; Bud exclaimed, with wild surmise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; He wants to be captain of my yacht, and he
refers me to Miss Dyce, for all the world as if he were a
housemaid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m <i>so</i> glad,&rdquo; cried Bud.&nbsp;
&ldquo;For it was I who advised him to, and
I&rsquo;m&mdash;I&rsquo;m the referee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; it was Kate&rsquo;s letter, and she&mdash;and
we&mdash;and I said there was a rumour you wanted a captain, and
he should apply, saying if you wanted to know just what a clean,
good, brave sailor he was you should ask Kate MacNeill or Miss
Dyce, and I&rsquo;m the Miss Dyce this time, and
you&rsquo;re&mdash;why, you&rsquo;re really visiting
me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lady Anne laughed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Really, Miss Lennox,&rdquo;
she said, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re a wonderful diplomatist.&nbsp; I
must get the Earl to put you in the service.&nbsp; I believe
there&rsquo;s a pretty decent salary goes to our representative
in the United States.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But don&rsquo;t laugh at me, Lady Anne,&rdquo; pleaded
Bud earnestly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m dre&rsquo;ffle set on
having Charles off the cargo boats, where he&rsquo;s thrown
away.&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t know how Kate loves him, and she
hasn&rsquo;t seen him&mdash;not for years and years.&nbsp; You
know yourself what it is to be so far away from anybody you
love.&nbsp; He&rsquo;d just fit your yacht like a
glove&mdash;he&rsquo;s so educated, having been on the yachts and
with the gentry round the world.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s got everything
nice about him you&rsquo;d look for in a sailor&mdash;big brown
eyes so beautiful there&rsquo;s only Gaelic words I don&rsquo;t
know, but that sound like somebody breaking glass, to describe
how sweet they are.&nbsp; And the whitest teeth!&nbsp; When he
walks, he walks so straight and hits the ground so hard
you&rsquo;d think he owned the land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems to me,&rdquo; said Lady Anne, &ldquo;that you
<a name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
179</span>couldn&rsquo;t be more enthusiastic about your
<i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;</i> if you loved him
yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I do,&rdquo; said Bud, with the utmost
frankness.&nbsp; &ldquo;But there&rsquo;s really nothing between
us.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s meant for Kate.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s got heaps
of beaux, but he&rsquo;s her steady.&nbsp; I gave him up to her
for good on Hallowe&rsquo;en, and she&rsquo;s so
happy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bell had thrown off her cooking-apron and cleaned her hands,
and ran up the stairs to see that her hair was trim, for though
she loved a Lady for the sake of Scotland&rsquo;s history, she
someway felt in the presence of Lady Anne the awe she had as a
child for Barbara Mushet.&nbsp; That Ailie in such company should
be, on the other hand, so composed, and sometimes even comical,
was a marvel she never could get over.&nbsp; &ldquo;I never
feared the face of earl or man,&rdquo; she would say, &ldquo;but
I&rsquo;m scared for a titled lady.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When she came down to the parlour the visitor was rising to
go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Miss Dyce,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so
glad to see you, though my visit this time&rsquo;s really to Miss
Lennox.&nbsp; I wished to consult her about a captain for my
little yacht.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Lennox!&rdquo; exclaimed Miss Bell, shaking hands,
and with a look of apprehension at her amazing niece.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Lady Anne; &ldquo;she has recommended
a man who seems in all respects quite suitable, if he happens to
know a little about sailing; and I&rsquo;m going to write to him
to come and see me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that, I must confess it, Lennox for once forgot her manners
and darted from the parlour to tell Kate the glorious news.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kate, you randy!&rdquo; she cried, bursting into the
kitchen&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;&lsquo;I sent a letter to my love and by
the way I dropped it,<br />
I dropped it, I dropped it; I dree&mdash;I dree&mdash;I dropped
it&rsquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve fixed it up for Charles; he&rsquo;s to be
the captain.&rdquo;&nbsp; The servant danced on the floor in a
speechless transport, and Bud danced too.</p>
<h2><a name="page180"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
180</span>CHAPTER XXI.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Too</span> slow, far too slow, passed the
lengthening days.&nbsp; Kate was bedded by nine to make them
shorter by an hour or two, but what she took from the foot of the
day she tacked to the head of it, as Paddy in the story eked his
blanket, and she was up in the mornings long before Wanton Wully
rang the six-hours&rsquo; bell.&nbsp; The elder
Dyces&mdash;saving Ailie, who knew all about it, hearing it from
Bud in passionate whispers as they lay together in one bed in the
brightening morns of May&mdash;might think summer&rsquo;s coming
was what made the household glad, Kate sing like the laverock,
and Lennox so happy and so good, but it was the thought of
Charles.&nbsp; &ldquo;Dear me! you&rsquo;ve surely taken a
desperate fancy for Prince Charlie songs,&rdquo; would Miss Bell
remark to Bud and the maid of Colonsay.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is there not
another ditty in the ballant?&rdquo; and they would glance at
each other guiltily but never let on.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Come o&rsquo;er the stream, Charlie,
dear Charlie, brave Charlie,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Come o&rsquo;er the stream, Charlie, and I&rsquo;ll
be Maclean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&mdash;Bud composed that one in a jiffy sitting one day at the
kitchen window, and of all the noble Jacobite measures Kate liked
it best, &ldquo;it was so clever, and so desperate like the
thing!&rdquo;&nbsp; Such a daft disease is love!&nbsp; To the
woman whose recollection of the mariner was got from olden
Sabbath walks &rsquo;tween churches in the windy isle, among the
mossy tombs, and to Bud, who had never seen him, but had made for
herself a portrait blent of the youth so gay and gallant Kate
described, and of George Sibley Purser, <a
name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 181</span>and of dark
ear-ringed men of the sea that in &ldquo;The Tempest&rdquo; cry
&ldquo;Heigh, my hearts! cheerily, cheerily, cheerily, my hearts!
yare, yare,&rdquo; the prospect of his presence was a giddy
joy.</p>
<p>And after all the rascal came without warning, to be for a day
and a night within sound of Kate&rsquo;s minstrelsy without her
knowing it, for he lodged, an ardent but uncertain man, on the
other side of the garden-wall, little thinking himself the cause
and object of these musical mornings.&nbsp; Bud found him
out&mdash;that clever one! who was surely come from America to
set all the Old World right,&mdash;she found him at the launching
of the <i>Wave</i>.</p>
<p>Lady Anne&rsquo;s yacht dozed like a hedgehog under leaves
through the winter months below the beeches on what we call the
hard&mdash;on the bank of the river under Jocka&rsquo;s house,
where the water&rsquo;s brackish, and the launching of her was
always of the nature of a festival, for the Earl&rsquo;s men were
there, John Taggart&rsquo;s band, with &ldquo;A life on the Ocean
Wave&rdquo; between each passage of the jar of old Tom
Watson&rsquo;s home-made ale&mdash;not tipsy lads but jovial, and
even the children of the schools, for it happened on a
Saturday.</p>
<p>Bud and Footles went with each other and the rest of the
bairns, unknown to their people, for in adventures such as these
the child delighted, and was wisely never interdicted.</p>
<p>The man who directed the launch was a stranger in a
foreign-looking soft slouch hat&mdash;Charles plain to identify
in every feature, in the big brown searching eyes that only
Gaelic could do justice to, and his walk so steeve and steady,
his lovely beard, his tread on the hard as if he owned the land,
his voice on the deck as if he were the master of the sea.&nbsp;
She stood apart and watched him, fascinated, and could not leave
even when the work was done and the band was home-returning,
charming the road round the bay with &ldquo;Peggy Baxter&rsquo;s
Quickstep.&rdquo;&nbsp; He saw her lingering, smiled on her, and
beckoned on her to cross the gangway that led to the yacht from
the little jetty.</p>
<p><a name="page182"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
182</span>&ldquo;Well, wee lady,&rdquo; said he, with one big
hand on her head and another on the dog, &ldquo;is this the first
of my crew at a quay-head jump?&nbsp; Sign on at once and
I&rsquo;ll make a sailor of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, please,&rdquo; said she, looking up in his face,
too anxious to enter into his humour, &ldquo;are you our
Kate&rsquo;s Charles?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kate!&rdquo; said he, reflecting, with a hand in his
beard, through which his white teeth shone.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s such a wheen of Kates here and there, and
all of them fine, fine gyurls!&nbsp; Still-and-on, if yours is
like most of her name that I&rsquo;m acquaint with, I&rsquo;m the
very man for her; and my name, indeed, is what you might be
calling Charles.&nbsp; In fact,&rdquo;&mdash;in a burst of
confidence, seating himself on a water-breaker,&mdash;&ldquo;my
Christian name is Charles&mdash;Charlie, for short among the
gentry.&nbsp; You are not speaking, by any chance, of one called
Kate MacNeill?&rdquo; he added, showing some red in the tan of
his countenance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I am,&rdquo; said Bud reproachfully.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Oh, men! men!&nbsp; As if there could be any other!&nbsp;
I hope to goodness you love her same as you said you did, and
haven&rsquo;t been&mdash;been carrying-on with any other Kates
for a diversion.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m Lennox Dyce.&nbsp; Your Kate
stays with me and Uncle Dan, and Auntie Bell, and Auntie Ailie,
and this sweet little dog by the name of Footles.&nbsp;
She&rsquo;s so jolly!&nbsp; My! won&rsquo;t she be tickled to
know you&rsquo;ve come?&nbsp; And&mdash;and how&rsquo;s the
world, Captain Charles?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The world?&rdquo; he said, aback, looking at her
curiously as she seated herself beside him on a hatch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, the world, you know&mdash;the places you were
in,&rdquo; with a wave of the hand that seemed to mean the
universe.</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;&lsquo;Edinburgh, Leith,<br />
Portobello, Musselburgh, and Dalkeith?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&mdash;No, that&rsquo;s Kate&rsquo;s favourite geography
lesson, &rsquo;cause she can sing it.&nbsp; I mean Rotterdam, and
Santander, <a name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
183</span>and Bilbao&mdash;all the lovely places on the map where
a letter takes four days and a twopence-ha&rsquo;penny stamp,
and&rsquo;s mighty apt to smell of rope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, them!&rdquo; said he, with the warmth of
recollection, &ldquo;they&rsquo;re not so bad&mdash;in fact,
they&rsquo;re just A1.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the like of there you see
life and spend the money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you been in Italy?&rdquo; asked Bud.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d love to see that old Italy&mdash;for the sake of
Romeo and Juliet, you know, and my dear, dear Portia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>I</i> know,&rdquo; said Charles.&nbsp; &ldquo;Allow
me!&nbsp; Perfect beauties, all fine, fine gyurls; but I
don&rsquo;t think very much of dagoes.&nbsp; I have slept in
their sailors&rsquo; homes, and never hear Italy mentioned but I
feel I want to scratch myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dagoes!&rdquo; cried Bud; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s what Jim
called them.&nbsp; Have you been in America?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have I been in America?&nbsp; I should think I
have,&rdquo; said he emphatically, &ldquo;The Lakes.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s yonder you get value&mdash;two dollars a-day and
everywhere respected like a perfect gentleman.&nbsp; Men&rsquo;s
not mice out yonder in America.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you maybe have been in Chicago?&rdquo; cried Bud,
her face filled with a happy expectation as she pressed the dog
in her arms till its fringe mixed with her own wild curls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chicago?&rdquo; said the Captain.&nbsp; &ldquo;Allow
me!&nbsp; Many a time.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll maybe not believe it,
but it was there I bought this hat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; cried Bud, with the tears in her eyes and
speechless for a moment, &ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;could just hug
that hat.&nbsp; Won&rsquo;t you please let me&mdash;let me pat
it?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pat away,&rdquo; said Captain Charles, laughing, and
took it off with the sweep of a cavalier that was in itself a
compliment.&nbsp; &ldquo;You know yon place&mdash;Chicago?&rdquo;
he asked, as she patted his headgear fondly and returned it to
him.&nbsp; For a little her mind was far away from the deck of
Lady Anne&rsquo;s yacht, her eyes on the ripple of the tide, her
nostrils full, and her little bosom heaving.</p>
<p><a name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
184</span>&ldquo;You were there?&rdquo; he asked again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Chicago&rsquo;s where I lived,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;That was mother&rsquo;s place,&rdquo; and into his ear she
poured a sudden flood of reminiscence&mdash;of her father and
mother, and the travelling days and lodging-houses, and Mr and
Mrs Molyneux, and the graves in the far-off cemetery.&nbsp; The
very thought of them all made her again American in accent and in
phrase.&nbsp; He listened, understanding, feeling the vexation of
that far-sundering by the sea as only a sailor can, and clapped
her on the shoulder, and looking at him she saw that in his eyes
which made her love him more than ever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh my!&rdquo; she said bravely, &ldquo;here I&rsquo;m
talking away to you about myself, and I&rsquo;m no more account
than a rabbit under these present circumstances, Captain Charles,
and all the time you&rsquo;re just pining to know all about your
Kate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Captain tugged his beard and reddened again.&nbsp;
&ldquo;A fine, fine gyurl!&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
hope&mdash;I hope she&rsquo;s pretty well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s fine,&rdquo; said Bud, nodding her head
gravely.&nbsp; &ldquo;You bet Kate can walk now without taking
hold.&nbsp; Why, there&rsquo;s never anything wrong with her
&rsquo;cepting now and then the croodles, and they&rsquo;re not
anything lingering.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was a kind of a rumour that she was at times a
trifle delicate,&rdquo; said Charles.&nbsp; &ldquo;In fact, it
was herself who told me, in her letters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bud blushed.&nbsp; This was one of the few details of her
correspondence on which she and Kate had differed.&nbsp; It had
been her idea that an invalidish hint at intervals produced a
nice and tender solicitude in the roving sailor, and she had, at
times, credited the maid with some of Mrs Molyneux&rsquo;s old
complaints, a little modified and more romantic, though Kate
herself maintained that illness in a woman under eighty was
looked upon as anything but natural or interesting in
Colonsay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was nothing but&mdash;but love,&rdquo; she said now,
confronted with the consequence of her imaginative <a
name="page185"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
185</span>cunning.&nbsp; &ldquo;You know what love is, Captain
Charles?&nbsp; A powerfully weakening thing, though I don&rsquo;t
think it would hurt anybody if they wouldn&rsquo;t take it so
much to heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to hear it&rsquo;s only&mdash;only what
you mention,&rdquo; said Charles, much relieved.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
thought it might be something inward, and that maybe she was
working too hard at her education.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, she&rsquo;s not taking her education so bad as all
that,&rdquo; Bud assured him.&nbsp; &ldquo;She isn&rsquo;t
wasting to a shadow sitting up nights with a wet towel on her
head soaking in the poets and figuring sums.&nbsp; All she wanted
was to be sort of middling smart, but nothing gaudy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Charles looked sideway keenly at the child as she sat
beside him, half afraid himself of the irony he had experienced
among her countrymen, but saw it was not here.&nbsp; Indeed it
never was in Lennox Dyce, for all her days she had the sweet
engaging self-unconsciousness no training can command; frankness,
fearlessness, and respect for all her fellows&mdash;the gifts
that will never fail to make the proper friends.&nbsp; She talked
so composedly that he was compelled to frankness himself on a
subject no money could have made him speak about to any one a
week ago.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Between you and me and the mast,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m feared Kate has got far too clever for the like
of me, and that&rsquo;s the way I have not called on
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;d best look pretty spry,&rdquo; said
Bud, pointing a monitory finger at him; &ldquo;for there&rsquo;s
beaux all over the place that&rsquo;s wearing their Sunday
clothes week-days, and washing their faces night and morning,
hankering to tag on to her, and she&rsquo;ll maybe tire of
standing out in the cold for you.&nbsp; I wouldn&rsquo;t be
skeered, Cap&rsquo;, if I was you; she&rsquo;s not too clever for
or&rsquo;nary use; she&rsquo;s nicer than ever she was that time
you used to walk with her in Colonsay.&rdquo;&nbsp; Bud was
beginning to be alarmed at the misgivings to which her own
imaginings had given rise.</p>
<p><a name="page186"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
186</span>&ldquo;If you saw her letters,&rdquo; said Charles
gloomily.&nbsp; &ldquo;Poetry and foreign princes.&nbsp; One of
them great at the dancing!&nbsp; He kissed her hand.&nbsp; He
would never have ventured a thing like that if she hadn&rsquo;t
given him encouragement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just diversion,&rdquo; said Bud consolingly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;She was only&mdash;she was only putting by the time; and
she often says she&rsquo;ll only marry for her own conveniency,
and the man for her is&mdash;well, <i>you</i> know, Captain
Charles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was a Russian army officer,&rdquo; proceeded the
seaman, still suffering a jealous doubt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he&rsquo;s dead.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s deader &rsquo;n
canned beans.&nbsp; Mr Wanton gied him&mdash;gied him the <span
class="GutSmall">BAGGONET</span>.&nbsp; There wasn&rsquo;t really
anything in it anyway.&nbsp; Kate didn&rsquo;t care for him the
tiniest bit, and I guess it was a great relief.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then she&rsquo;s learning the piano,&rdquo; said the
Captain; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s not like a working gyurl.&nbsp; And
she talked in one of her letters about sitting on Uncle
Dan&rsquo;s knee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bud dropped the dog at her feet and burst into laughter: in
that instance she had certainly badly jumbled the identities.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing to laugh at,&rdquo; said the
Captain, tugging his beard.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not at all
becoming in a decent gyurl; and it&rsquo;s not like the Kate I
knew in Colonsay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bud saw the time had come for a full confession.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Captain Charles,&rdquo; she said, when she recovered
herself, &ldquo;it&mdash;it wasn&rsquo;t Kate said that at all;
it was another girl called Winifred Wallace.&nbsp; You see, Kate
is always so busy doing useful things&mdash;<i>such</i> soup!
and&mdash;and a washing every Monday, and taking her education,
and the pens were all so dev&mdash;so&mdash;so stupid, that she
simply had to get some one to help her write those letters; and
that&rsquo;s why Winifred Wallace gave a hand and messed things
up a bit, I guess.&nbsp; Where the letters talked solemn sense
about the weather and the bad fishing and bits about <a
name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 187</span>Oronsay,
and where they told you to be sure and change your stockings when
you came downstairs from the mast, out the wet, and where they
said you were the very, very one she loved, that was Kate; but
when there was a lot of dinky talk about princes and Russian army
officers and slabs of poetry, that was just Winifred Wallace
putting on lugs and showing off.&nbsp; No, it wasn&rsquo;t all
showing off; it was because she kind of loved you herself.&nbsp;
You see she didn&rsquo;t have any beau of her own, Mr Charles;
and&mdash;and she thought it wouldn&rsquo;t be depriving Kate of
anything to pretend, for Kate said there was no depravity in
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s Winifred Wallace?&rdquo; asked the
surprised sailor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m all the Winifred Wallace there is,&rdquo;
said Bud penitently.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my poetry
name,&mdash;it&rsquo;s my other me.&nbsp; I can do a heap of
things when I&rsquo;m Winifred I can&rsquo;t do when I&rsquo;m
plain Bud, or else I&rsquo;d laugh at myself enough to hurt,
I&rsquo;m so mad.&nbsp; Are you angry, Mr Charles?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Och! just Charles to you,&rdquo; said the sailor.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Never heed the honours.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not angry a
bit.&nbsp; Allow me!&nbsp; In fact, I&rsquo;m glad to find the
prince and the piano and the poetry were all nonsense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought that poetry pretty middling myself,&rdquo;
admitted Bud, but in a hesitating way that made him look very
guilty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The poetry,&rdquo; said he quickly, &ldquo;was
splendid.&nbsp; There was nothing wrong with it that I could see;
but I&rsquo;m glad it wasn&rsquo;t Kate&rsquo;s&mdash;for
she&rsquo;s a fine, fine gyurl, and brought up most
respectable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Bud; &ldquo;she&rsquo;s better
&rsquo;n any poetry.&nbsp; You must feel gay because you are
going to marry her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not so sure of her marrying me.&nbsp; She
maybe wouldn&rsquo;t have me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But she can&rsquo;t help it!&rdquo; cried Bud.&nbsp;
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s bound to, for the witch-lady fixed it on
Hallowe&rsquo;en.&nbsp; Only, I hope you won&rsquo;t marry her
for years and years.&nbsp; <a name="page188"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 188</span>Why, Auntie Bell &rsquo;d go crazy
if you took away our Kate; for good girls ain&rsquo;t so easy to
get nowadays as they used to be when they had three pound ten in
the half-year, and nailed their trunks down to the floor of a new
place when they got it, for fear they might be bounced.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;d be vexed I helped do anything if you married her for a
long while.&nbsp; Besides, you&rsquo;d be sorry yourself, for her
education is not quite done; she&rsquo;s only up to Compound
Multiplication and the Tudor Kings.&nbsp; You&rsquo;d just be
sick sorry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Course you would!&nbsp; That&rsquo;s love.&nbsp; Before
one marries it&rsquo;s hunkydory&mdash;it&rsquo;s fairy all the
time; but after that it&rsquo;s the same old face at breakfast,
Mr Cleland says, and simply putting up with one another.&nbsp;
Oh, love&rsquo;s a wonderful thing, Charles; it&rsquo;s the Great
Thing, but sometimes I say &lsquo;Give me Uncle Dan!&rsquo;&nbsp;
Promise you&rsquo;ll not go marrying Kate right off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sailor roared with laughter.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lord!&rdquo;
said he, &ldquo;if I wait too long I&rsquo;ll be wanting to marry
yourself, for you&rsquo;re a dangerous gyurl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m never going to marry,&rdquo; said
Bud.&nbsp; &ldquo;I want to go right on loving everybody, and
don&rsquo;t yearn for any particular man tagging on to
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never heard so much about love in English all my
life,&rdquo; said Charles, &ldquo;though it&rsquo;s common enough
and quite respectable in Gaelic.&nbsp; Do you&mdash;do you love
myself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Course I do!&rdquo; said Bud, cuddling Footles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said he firmly, &ldquo;the sooner I sign
on with Kate the better, for you&rsquo;re a dangerous
gyurl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they went down the road together, planning ways of early
foregatherings with Kate, and you may be sure Bud&rsquo;s way was
cunningest.</p>

189</span>CHAPTER XXII.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Kate that afternoon was told
her hour was come, and that to-morrow she must meet her destined
mariner, she fell into a chair, threw her apron over her head,
and cried and laughed horribly turn about&mdash;the victim of
hysteria that was half from fear and half from a bliss too deep
and unexpected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mercy on me!&rdquo; she exclaimed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now
he&rsquo;ll find out everything, and what a stupid one I
am.&nbsp; All my education&rsquo;s clean gone out of my head;
I&rsquo;m sure I couldn&rsquo;t spell an article.&nbsp; I canna
even mind the ninth commandment, let alone the Reasons Annexed;
and as for grammar, whether it&rsquo;s &lsquo;Give the book to
Bud and me&rsquo; or &lsquo;Give the book to Bud and I,&rsquo; is
more than I could tell you if my very life depended on it.&nbsp;
Oh, Lennox! now we&rsquo;re going to catch it!&nbsp; Are you
certain sure he said to-morrow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bud gazed at her disdainfully and stamped her foot.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Stop that, Kate MacNeill!&rdquo; she commanded.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t act so silly.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s as
skeered of you as you can be of him.&nbsp; He&rsquo;d have been
here Friday before the morning milk if he didn&rsquo;t think
you&rsquo;d be the sort to back him into a corner and ask him
questions about ancient Greece and Rome.&nbsp; Seems to me love
makes some folk idiotic; lands sake! I&rsquo;m mighty glad it
always leaves me calm as a plate of pumpkin pie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is&mdash;is&mdash;he looking tremendously genteel and
well-put-on?&rdquo; asked the maid of Colonsay, with anxious
lines on her forehead.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is he&mdash;is he as nice as
I said he was?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
190</span>&ldquo;He was everything you said&mdash;except the
Gaelic.&nbsp; I knew he couldn&rsquo;t be so bad as that sounded
that you said about his eyes.&nbsp; I&mdash;I never saw a more
becoming man.&nbsp; If I had known just how noble he looked,
I&rsquo;d have sent him stacks of poetry,&rdquo; whereat Kate
moaned again, rocked herself in her chair most piteously, and
swore she could never have the impudence to see him till she had
her new frock from the dressmakers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be thinking I&rsquo;m refined and quite the
lady,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and I&rsquo;m just the same plain
Kate I was in Colonsay, and him a regular Captain!&nbsp; It was
all your fault, with your fancy letters.&nbsp; Oh, Lennox Dyce, I
think I hate you, just: lend me your hanky,&mdash;mine&rsquo;s
all wet with greeting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you weren&rsquo;t so big and temper wasn&rsquo;t
sinful, I&rsquo;d shake you!&rdquo; said Bud, producing her
handkerchief.&nbsp; &ldquo;You were just on your last legs for a
sailor, and you&rsquo;d never have put a hand on one if I
didn&rsquo;t write these letters.&nbsp; And now, when the
sweetest sailor in the land is brought to your doorstep, you
don&rsquo;t &rsquo;preciate your privileges and have a grateful
heart, but turn round and yelp at me.&nbsp; I tell you, Kate
MacNeill, sailors are mighty scarce and sassy in a little place
like this, and none too easy picked up, and &rsquo;stead of
sitting there, with a smut on your nose and tide-marks on your
eyebrows, mourning, you&rsquo;d best arise and shine, or somebody
with their wits about them &rsquo;ll snap him up.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d
do it myself if it wouldn&rsquo;t be not honourable to
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! if I just had another week or two&rsquo;s
geography!&rdquo; said Kate dolefully.</p>
<p>Bud had to laugh&mdash;she could not help herself; and the
more she laughed, the more tragic grew the servant&rsquo;s
face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seems to me,&rdquo; said Bud, &ldquo;that I&rsquo;ve
got to run this loving business all along the line: you
don&rsquo;t know the least thing about it after g-o, go.&nbsp;
Why, Kate, I&rsquo;m telling you Charles is afraid of you more
than you are of him.&nbsp; He thought you&rsquo;d be that
educated you&rsquo;d wear specs, and stand quite stiff talking
poetry all the <a name="page191"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
191</span>time, and I had to tell him every dinky bit in these
letters were written by me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then that&rsquo;s worse!&rdquo; cried the servant, more
distressed than ever.&nbsp; &ldquo;For he&rsquo;ll think I canna
write myself, and I can write like fury if you only give me a
decent pen, and shut the door, and don&rsquo;t bother
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No fears!&rdquo; said Bud; &ldquo;I made that all
right.&nbsp; I said you were too busy housekeeping, and I guess
it&rsquo;s more a housekeeper than a school-ma&rsquo;rm Charles
needs.&nbsp; Anyhow, he&rsquo;s so much in love with you,
he&rsquo;d marry you if you were only half-way through the
Twopenny.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s plump head over heels, and it&rsquo;s
up to you, as a sensible girl, not to conceal that you like him
some yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not know what to say to him,&rdquo; said
Kate, &ldquo;and he always was so clever: half the time I couldna
understand him if it wasn&rsquo;t for his eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he&rsquo;ll know what to say to you, I guess, if
all the signs are right.&nbsp; Charles is not so shy as all
that,&mdash;love-making is where he lives; and he made goo-goo
eyes at myself without an introduction.&nbsp; You&rsquo;d fancy,
to hear you, he was a school inspector, and he&rsquo;s only just
an or&rsquo;nary lover thinking of the happy days you used to
have in Colonsay.&nbsp; If I was you I&rsquo;d not let on I was
anything but what I really was; I&rsquo;d be natural&mdash;yes,
that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;d be, for being natural&rsquo;s the
deadliest thing below the canopy to make folk love you.&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t pretend, but just be the same Kate MacNeill to him
you are to me.&nbsp; Just you listen to him, and now and then
look at him, and don&rsquo;t think of a darned thing&mdash;I
mean, don&rsquo;t think of a blessed thing but how nice he is,
and he&rsquo;ll be so pleased and so content he&rsquo;ll not even
ask you to spell cat&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Content!&rdquo; cried Kate, with conviction.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Not him!&nbsp; Fine I ken him!&nbsp; He&rsquo;ll want to
kiss me, as sure as God&rsquo;s in heaven,&mdash;beg your
pardon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I expect that&rsquo;s not a thing you should say to
me,&rdquo; said Bud, blushing deeply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I begged your pardon,&rdquo; said the maid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean that about God in heaven,
that&rsquo;s right&mdash;so He is, or where would <i>we</i> be?
what I <a name="page192"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
192</span>meant was about the kissing.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m old enough
for love, but I&rsquo;m not old enough for you to be talking to
me about kissing.&nbsp; I guess Auntie Ailie wouldn&rsquo;t like
to have you talk to me about a thing like that, and Auntie Bell,
she&rsquo;d be furious&mdash;it&rsquo;s too advanced.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What time am I to see him?&rdquo; asked Kate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the morning.&nbsp; If you go out to the garden just
after breakfast, and whistle, he&rsquo;ll look over the
wall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The morning!&rdquo; cried the maid aghast.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t face him in the morning.&nbsp; Who ever
heard of such a thing?&nbsp; Now you have gone away and spoiled
everything!&nbsp; I could hardly have all my wits about me even
if it was only gloaming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bud sighed despairingly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, you don&rsquo;t
understand, Kate,&rdquo; said she.&nbsp; &ldquo;He wanted it to
be the evening, too, but I said you weren&rsquo;t a miserable
pair of owls, and the best time for anything is the
morning.&nbsp; Uncle Dan says the first half-hour in the morning
is worth three hours at any other time of the day, for when
you&rsquo;ve said your prayers, and had a good bath, and a clean
shave, and your boots new on&mdash;no slippers nor slithery
dressing-gowns, the peace of God, and&mdash;and&mdash;and the
assurance of strength and righteousness descends upon you so that
you&mdash;you&mdash;you can tackle wild-cats.&nbsp; I feel so
brash and brave myself in the morning I could skip the hills like
a goat.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s simply got to be the morning, Kate
MacNeill.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s when you look your very best, if you
care to take a little trouble, and don&rsquo;t simply just slouch
through, and I&rsquo;m set on having you see him first time over
the garden wall.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the only way to fix the thing
up romantic, seeing we haven&rsquo;t any balcony.&nbsp;
You&rsquo;ll go out and stand against the blossom of the
cherry-tree, and hold a basket of flowers and parsley, and when
he peeks over and sees you looming out in the picture, I tell you
he&rsquo;ll be tickled to death.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the way
Shakespeare &rsquo;d fix it, and he knew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think much of Shakespeare,&rdquo; said
Kate.&nbsp; &ldquo;Fancy yon Igoa!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Iago, you mean; well, what about him?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page193"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
193</span>&ldquo;The wickedness of him; such a lot of
lies!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pooh!&rdquo; said Bud.&nbsp; &ldquo;He was only for the
effect.&nbsp; Of course there never really was such a mean wicked
man as that Iago,&mdash;there couldn&rsquo;t be; but Shakespeare
made him just so&rsquo;s you&rsquo;d like the nice folk all the
more by thinking what they might have been if God had let Himself
go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That night Kate was abed by eight.&nbsp; Vainly the town cried
for her&mdash;the cheerful passage of feet on the pavement, and a
tinkler piper at the Cross, and she knew how bright was the
street, with the late-lit windows of the shops, and how
intoxicating was the atmosphere of Saturday in the dark; but
having said her Lord&rsquo;s Prayer in Gaelic, and &ldquo;Now I
lay me down to sleep&rdquo; in English, she covered her head with
the blankets and thought of the coming day with joy and
apprehension, until she fell asleep.</p>
<p>In the morning Miss Bell had no sooner gone up to the making
of beds, that was her Sabbath care to save the servant-maid from
too much sin, and Ailie to her weekly reading with the invalid
Duncan Gill, than Bud flew into the kitchen to make Kate ready
for her tryst.&nbsp; Never in this world were breakfast dishes
sooner cleaned and dried than by that eager pair: no sooner were
they done than Kate had her chest-lid up and had dived, head
foremost, among her Sunday finery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; asked Bud.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going to put on glad rags, are
you?&rdquo;&nbsp; For out there came a blue gown, fondled
tenderly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I am,&rdquo; said Kate.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s either that or my print for it, and a print
wrapper would not be the thing at all to meet&mdash;meet the
Captain in; he&rsquo;ll be expecting me to be truly
refined.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think he&rsquo;d like the wrapper better,&rdquo; said
Bud gravely.&nbsp; &ldquo;The blue gown&rsquo;s very
nice&mdash;but it&rsquo;s not Kate, somehow: do you know, I think
it&rsquo;s Auntie Ailie up to the waist, and the banker&rsquo;s
cook in the lacey bits above that, and it don&rsquo;t make you
refined a bit.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not what you put on that makes
you <a name="page194"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
194</span>refined, it&rsquo;s things you can&rsquo;t take
off.&nbsp; You have no idea how sweet you look in that print,
Kate, with your cap and apron.&nbsp; You look better in them than
if you wore the latest yell of fashion.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d want to
marry you myself if I was a captain, and saw you dressed like
that; but if you had on your Sunday gown
I&rsquo;d&mdash;I&rsquo;d bite my lip and go home and ask advice
from mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate put past the blue gown, not very willingly, but she had
learned by now that in some things Bud had better judgment than
herself.&nbsp; She washed and dried her face till it shone like a
polished apple, put on Bud&rsquo;s choice of a cap and streamered
apron, and was about to take a generous dash of Florida Water
when she found her hand restrained.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d have no scent,&rdquo; said Bud.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I like scent myself, some, and I just dote on our Florida
Water, but Auntie Ailie says the scent of clean water, sun, and
air, is the sweetest a body can have about one, and any other
kind&rsquo;s as rude as Keating&rsquo;s Powder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be expecting the Florida Water,&rdquo; said
Kate, &ldquo;seeing it was himself that sent it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It don&rsquo;t amount to a hill of beans,&rdquo; said
Bud; &ldquo;you can wear our locket, and that&rsquo;ll please
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate went with a palpitating heart through the scullery, out
into the garden, with a basket in her hand, a pleasing and
expansive figure.&nbsp; Bud would have liked to watch her, but a
sense of delicacy prevented, and she stood at the kitchen window
looking resolutely into the street.&nbsp; On his way down the
stairs Mr Dyce was humming the Hundredth Psalm; outside the shops
were shuttered, and the harmony of the morning hymn came from the
baker&rsquo;s open windows.&nbsp; A few folk passed in their
Sunday clothes, at a deliberate pace, to differentiate it from
the secular hurry of other days.&nbsp; Soon the church bell would
ring for the Sabbath-school, and Bud must be ready.&nbsp;
Remembering it, a sense of some impiety took possession of
her&mdash;worldly trysts in back gardens on the Sabbath were not
what <a name="page195"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
195</span>Aunt Bell would much approve of.&nbsp; Had they met
yet?&nbsp; How did Charles look?&nbsp; What did Kate say?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mercy on me!&rdquo; cried the maid, bursting in through
the scullery.&nbsp; &ldquo;Did you say I was to
whistle!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Bud, and then looked
horrified.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, Kate,&rdquo; said she in a whisper,
&ldquo;I was so keen on the vain things of this wicked world I
quite forgot it was the Lord&rsquo;s Day; of course you
can&rsquo;t go whistling on Sunday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I was just thinking to myself,&rdquo;
said the maid, not very heartily.&nbsp; &ldquo;But I thought I
would ask you.&nbsp; It wouldn&rsquo;t need to be a tune,
but&mdash;but of course it would be awful wicked&mdash;forbye
Miss Dyce would be sure to hear me, and she&rsquo;s that
particular.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you can&rsquo;t whistle&mdash;you
daren&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Bud.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;d be
dre&rsquo;ffle wicked.&nbsp; But how&rsquo;d it do to throw a
stone?&nbsp; Not a rock, you know, but a nice little quiet wee
white Sunday pebble?&nbsp; You might like as not be throwing it
at Rodger&rsquo;s cats, and that would be a work of necessity and
mercy, for these cruel cats are just death on birds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there&rsquo;s not a single cat there,&rdquo;
explained the maid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; said Bud.&nbsp; &ldquo;You can heave
the pebble over the wall so that it&rsquo;ll be a warning to them
not to come poaching in our garden; there&rsquo;s sure to be some
on the other side just about to get on the wall, and if Charles
happens to be there too, can you help that?&rdquo; and Kate
retired again.</p>
<p>There was a pause, and then a sound of laughter.&nbsp; For ten
minutes Bud waited in an agony of curiosity, that was at last too
much for her, and she ventured to look out at the scullery
window&mdash;to see Charles chasing his adored one down the walk,
between the bleaching-green and the gooseberries.&nbsp; Kate was
making for the sanctuary of her kitchen, her face aflame, and all
her streamers flying, but was caught before she entered.</p>
<p><a name="page196"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
196</span>&ldquo;I told you!&rdquo; said she, as she came in
panting.&nbsp; &ldquo;We hadn&rsquo;t said twenty words when he
wanted to kiss me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why! was that the reason you ran?&rdquo; asked Bud,
astonished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye&mdash;yes,&rdquo; said the maid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seems to me it&rsquo;s not very encouraging to Charles,
then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but&mdash;but&mdash;I wasn&rsquo;t running all my
might,&rdquo; said Kate.</p>
<h2><a name="page197"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
197</span>CHAPTER XXIII.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Ta-ran-ta-ra</span>!&nbsp;
Ta-ran-ta-ra!</p>
<p>The world is coming for Lennox Dyce, the greedy world,
youth&rsquo;s first and worst beguiler, that promises so much,
but at the best has only bubbles to give, which borrow a moment
the splendour of the sun, then burst in the hands that grasp
them; the world that will have only our bravest and most clever
bairns, and takes them all from us one by one.&nbsp; I have seen
them go&mdash;scores of them, boys and girls, their foreheads
high, and the sun on their faces, and never one came back.&nbsp;
Now and then returned to the burgh in the course of years a man
or woman who bore a well-known name, and could recall old
stories, but they were not the same, and even if they were not
disillusioned, there was that in their flushed prosperity which
ill made up for the bright young spirits quelled.</p>
<p>Ta-ran-ta-ra!&nbsp; Ta-ran-ta-ra!</p>
<p>Yes, the world is coming, sure enough&mdash;on black and
yellow wheels, with a guard red-coated who bugles through the
glen.&nbsp; It is coming behind black horses, with thundering
hooves and foam-flecked harness, between bare hills, by gurgling
burns and lime-washed shepherd dwellings, or in the shadow of the
woods that simply stand where they are placed by God and
wait.&nbsp; It comes in a fur-collared coat&mdash;though it is
autumn weather&mdash;and in a tall silk hat, and looks amused at
the harmless country it has come to render discontent.</p>
<p>Ta-ran-ta-ra!&nbsp; Ta-ran-ta-ra!</p>
<p>Go back, world go back, and leave the little lass <a
name="page198"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 198</span>among her
dreams, with hearts that love and cherish.&nbsp; Go back, with
your false flowers and your gems of paste.&nbsp; Go back, world,
that for every ecstasy exacts a pang!</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>There were three passengers on the coach&mdash;the man with
the fur collar who sat on the box beside the driver, and the
Misses Duff behind.&nbsp; I am sorry now that once I thought to
make you smile at the pigeon hens, for to-day I&rsquo;m in more
Christian humour and my heart warms to them, seeing them come
safely home from their flight afar from their doo-cot, since they
it was who taught me first to make these symbols on the paper,
and at their worst they were but a little stupid, like the most
of us at times, and always with the best intent.&nbsp; They had
been to Edinburgh; they had been gone two weeks&mdash;their first
adventure in a dozen years.&nbsp; Miss Jean was happy, bringing
back with her a new crochet pattern, a book of Views, a tooth
gold-filled (she was so proud and spoke of it so often that it is
not rude to mention it), and a glow of art she had got from an
afternoon tea in a picture-gallery full of works in oil.&nbsp;
Amelia&rsquo;s spoils were a phrase that lasted her for
years&mdash;it was that Edinburgh was &ldquo;redolent of Robert
Louis,&rdquo; the boast that she had heard the great MacCaskill
preach, and got a lesson in the searing of harmless woods with
heated pokers.&nbsp; Such are the rewards of travel: I have come
home myself with as little for my time and money.</p>
<p>But between them they had brought back something
else&mdash;something to whisper about lest the man in front
should hear, and two or three times to look at as it lay in an
innocent roll beside the purse in Miss Amelia&rsquo;s
reticule.&nbsp; It might have been a serpent in its coils, so
timidly they glanced in at it, and snapped the bag shut with a
kind of shudder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At least it&rsquo;s not a very large one,&rdquo;
whispered Miss Jean, with the old excuse of the unhappy lass who
did the deadly sin.</p>
<p><a name="page199"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
199</span>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said her sister, &ldquo;it may,
indeed, be called quite&mdash;quite diminutive.&nbsp; The other
he showed us was so horribly large and&mdash;and vulgar, the very
look of it made me almost faint.&nbsp; But, oh I wish we could
have dispensed with the horrid necessity.&nbsp; After
twe&mdash;after so many years it looks like a confession of
weakness.&nbsp; I hope there will be no unpleasant talk about
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you may be sure there will, Amelia Duff,&rdquo;
said her sister.&nbsp; &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll cast up Barbara
Mushet to us; she will always be the perfect
teacher&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The paragon of all the virtues.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it is such a gossiping place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed it is,&rdquo; said Miss Amelia.&nbsp; &ldquo;It
is always redolent of&mdash;of scandal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you had never thought of it,&rdquo; said Miss
Jean, with a sigh and a vicious little shake of the
reticule.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am not blaming you, remember,
&rsquo;Melia; if we are doing wrong the blame of it is equally
between us, except perhaps a little more for me, for I <i>did</i>
think the big one was better value for the money.&nbsp; And yet
it made me grue, it looked so&mdash;so dastardly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jean,&rdquo; said her sister solemnly, &ldquo;if you
had taken the big one, I would have marched out of the shop
affronted.&nbsp; If it made you grue, it made me shudder.&nbsp;
Even with the small one, did you notice how the man looked at
us?&nbsp; I thought he felt ashamed to be selling such a thing:
perhaps he has a family.&nbsp; He said they were not very often
asked for.&nbsp; I assure you I felt very small, the way he said
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once more they bent their douce brown hats together over the
reticule and looked timidly in on the object of their shames and
fears.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, there it is, and it can&rsquo;t be
helped,&rdquo; said Miss Jean at last, despairingly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Let us hope and trust there will not be too frequent need
for it, for, I assure you, I have neither the strength nor
inclination.&rdquo;&nbsp; She snapped the bag shut again, and,
glancing up, saw the man with the fur collar looking over his
shoulder at them.</p>
<p><a name="page200"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
200</span>&ldquo;Strikes me, ladies,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the
stage coach, as an easy mark for the highwaymen who used to
permeate these parts, must have been a pretty merry proposition;
they&rsquo;d be apt to stub their toes on it if they came
sauntering up behind.&nbsp; John here&rdquo;&mdash;with an
inclination of his head towards the driver&mdash;&ldquo;tells me
he&rsquo;s on schedule time, and I allow he&rsquo;s making plenty
fuss clicking his palate, but I feel I want to get out and heave
rocks at his cattle, so&rsquo;s they&rsquo;d get a better gait on
&rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Jean was incapable of utterance; she was still too much
afraid of a stranger who, though gallantly helping them to the
top of the coach at Maryfield, could casually address herself and
Miss Amelia as &ldquo;dears,&rdquo; thrust cigars on the guard
and driver, and call them John and George at the very first
encounter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&mdash;we think this is fairly fast,&rdquo; Miss
Amelia ventured, surprised at her own temerity..&nbsp;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nineteen miles in two hours, and if it&rsquo;s
not so fast as a railway train it lets you enjoy the
scenery.&nbsp; It is very much admired, our scenery, it&rsquo;s
so&mdash;it&rsquo;s so characteristic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure!&rdquo; said the stranger, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
pretty tidy scenery as scenery goes, and scenery&rsquo;s my
forte.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;d have thought that John here &rsquo;d
have all this part of Caledonia stern and wild so much by heart
he&rsquo;d want to rush it and get to where the houses are; but
most the time his horses go so slow they step on their own feet
at every stride.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Possibly the coach is a novelty to you,&rdquo;
suggested Miss Amelia, made wondrous brave by two weeks&rsquo;
wild adventuring in Edinburgh.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&mdash;I take you
for an American.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So did my wife, and she knew, for she belonged out
mother&rsquo;s place,&rdquo; said the stranger, laughing.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve guessed right, first time.&nbsp; No, the
coach is no novelty to me; I&rsquo;ve been up against a few in
various places.&nbsp; If I&rsquo;m short of patience and want
more go just at present, it&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m full of a
<a name="page201"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 201</span>good
joke on an old friend I&rsquo;m going to meet at the end of these
obsequies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Obsequies?&rdquo; repeated Miss Amelia, with surprise,
and he laughed again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the end of the trip,&rdquo; he explained.&nbsp;
&ldquo;This particular friend is not expecting me, because I
hadn&rsquo;t a post-card, hate a letter, and don&rsquo;t seem to
have been within shout of a telegraph office since I left
Edinburgh this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have just come from Edinburgh ourselves,&rdquo; Miss
Jean chimed in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So!&rdquo; said the stranger, throwing his arm over the
back of his seat to enter more comfortably into the
conversation.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s picturesque.&nbsp; Pretty
peaceful, too.&nbsp; But it&rsquo;s liable to be a little shy of
the Thespian muse.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t know more than
Cooper&rsquo;s cow about Edinburgh when I got there last Sunday
fortnight, but I&rsquo;ve gone perusing around a bit since; and
say, my! she&rsquo;s fine and old!&nbsp; I wasn&rsquo;t half a
day in the city when I found out that when it came to the real
legit.&nbsp; Queen Mary was the king-pin of the outfit in
Edinburgh.&nbsp; Before I came to this country I couldn&rsquo;t
just place Mary; sometimes she was Bloody, and sometimes she was
Bonnie, but I suppose I must have mixed her up with some
no-account English queen of the same name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Edinburgh,&rdquo; said Miss Amelia, &ldquo;is redolent
of Mary Queen of Scots&mdash;and Robert Louis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It just is!&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
a little bedroom she had in the Castle yonder, no bigger than a
Chicago bathroom.&nbsp; Why, there&rsquo;s hardly room for a
nightmare in it&mdash;a skittish nightmare &rsquo;d kick the
transom out.&nbsp; There doesn&rsquo;t seem to be a single
dramatic line in the whole play that Mary didn&rsquo;t have to
herself.&nbsp; She was the entire cast, and the spot light was on
her for the abduction scene, the child-widow scene, the murder,
the battle, and the last tag at Fotheringay.&nbsp; Three husbands
and a lot of flirtations that didn&rsquo;t come to anything; her
portrait everywhere, and the newspapers tracking her up like old
Sleuth from that day to this!&nbsp; I guess Queen Lizzie put her
feet in it <a name="page202"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
202</span>when she killed Mary,&mdash;for Mary&rsquo;s the
star-line in history, and Lizzie&rsquo;s mainly celebrated for
spoiling a good Prince Albert coat on Walter Raleigh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He spoke so fast, he used such curious words and idioms which
the Misses Duff had never heard before nor read in books, that
they were sure again he was a dreadful person.&nbsp; With a
sudden thought of warnings to &ldquo;Beware of Pickpockets&rdquo;
she had seen in Edinburgh, Miss Amelia clutched so hard at the
chain of the reticule which held their purse as well as their
mystery that it broke, and the bag fell over the side of the
coach and, bursting open, scattered its contents on the road
unobserved by the guard, whose bugle at the moment was loudly
flourishing for the special delectation of a girl at work in a
neighbouring corn-field.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold hard, John,&rdquo; said the American, and before
the coach had quite stopped he was down on the highway recovering
the little teachers&rsquo; property.</p>
<p>The serpent had unwound its coils; it lay revealed in all its
hideousness&mdash;a teacher&rsquo;s tawse!</p>
<p>At such a sad exposure its owners could have wept.&nbsp; They
had never dreamt a tawse could look so vulgar and forbidding as
it looked when thus exposed to the eye of man on the King&rsquo;s
highway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, thank you <i>so</i> much,&rdquo; said Miss
Jean.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is so kind of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exceedingly kind, courteous beyond measure,&mdash;we
are more than obliged to you,&rdquo; cooed Miss Amelia, with a
face like a sunset as she rolled the leather up with nervous
fingers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got children, ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo; asked the American
seriously, as the coach proceeded on its way.</p>
<p>Miss Amelia Duff made the best joke of her life without
meaning it.&nbsp; &ldquo;Twenty-seven,&rdquo; said she, with an
air of great gratitude, and the stranger smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;School-ma&rsquo;rm.&nbsp; Now that&rsquo;s good, that
is; it puts me in mind of home, for I appreciate
school-ma&rsquo;rms so heartily that about as soon as I got out
of the school myself I married one.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve never done
<a name="page203"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 203</span>throwing
bouquets at myself about it ever since, but I&rsquo;m sorry for
the mites she could have been giving a good time to as well as
their education if it hadn&rsquo;t been that she&rsquo;s so much
mixed up with me.&nbsp; What made me ask about children was
that&mdash;that medieval animator.&nbsp; I haven&rsquo;t seen one
for years and years, not since old Deacon Springfield found me
astray in his orchard one night and hiking for a short cut
home.&nbsp; I thought they&rsquo;d been abolished by the treaty
of Berlin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Amelia thrust it hurriedly into the reticule.&nbsp;
&ldquo;We have never used one all our life,&rdquo; said she,
&ldquo;but now we fear we have to, and, as you see, it&rsquo;s
quite thin&mdash;it&rsquo;s quite a little one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it is,&rdquo; said the stranger solemnly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s thin,&mdash;it&rsquo;s translucent, you might
say; but I guess the kiddies are pretty little too, and
won&rsquo;t be able to make any allowance for the fact that you
could have had a larger size if you wanted.&nbsp; It may be light
on the fingers and mighty heavy on the feelings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what you said,&rdquo; whispered Miss
Amelia to her sister.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As moral suasion, belting don&rsquo;t cut ice,&rdquo;
went on the American.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s generally only a
safety-valve for a wrothy grown-up person with a temper and a
child that can&rsquo;t hit back&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what <i>you</i> said,&rdquo; whispered
Miss Jean to Miss Amelia, and never did two people look more
miserably guilty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What beats me,&rdquo; said the stranger, &ldquo;is that
you should have got along without it so far, and think it
necessary now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps&mdash;perhaps we won&rsquo;t use it,&rdquo;
said Miss Jean.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Except as&mdash;as a sort of symbol,&rdquo; added her
sister.&nbsp; &ldquo;We would never have dreamt of it if children
nowadays were not so different from what they used to
be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess folk&rsquo;s been saying that quite a
while,&rdquo; said the American.&nbsp; &ldquo;Children never were
like what they used to be.&nbsp; I reckons old Mother Nature
spits on <a name="page204"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
204</span>her hands and makes a fresh start with each baby, and
never turns out two alike.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s fun
to sit and watch &rsquo;em bloom.&nbsp; Pretty delicate blooms,
too!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t bear much pawing; just give them a bit of
shelter when the weather&rsquo;s cold, a prop to lean against if
they&rsquo;re leggy and the wind&rsquo;s high, and see that the
fertiliser is the proper brand.&nbsp; Whether they&rsquo;re going
to turn out like the picture on the packet or just only weeds
depends on the seedsman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you <i>don&rsquo;t</i> understand how rebellious
they can be!&rdquo; cried Miss Amelia with feeling.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And they haven&rsquo;t the old deference to their elders
that they used to have,&mdash;they&rsquo;re growing bold and
independent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Depends on the elders, I suppose.&nbsp; Over here I
think you folks think children come into the world just to please
grown-ups and do what they&rsquo;re told without any
thinking.&nbsp; In America it&rsquo;s looked at the other way
about: the children are considerably more important than their
elders, and the notion don&rsquo;t do any harm to either, far as
I can see.&nbsp; As for your rebels, ma&rsquo;am, I&rsquo;d
cherish &rsquo;em: rebellion&rsquo;s like a rash, it&rsquo;s
better out than in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ta-ran-ta-ra!&nbsp; The bugle broke upon their conversation;
the coach emerged from the wood and dashed down hill, and,
wheeling through the arches, drew up at the inn.</p>
<p>The American helped the ladies to alight, took off his hat,
bade them good-day, and turned to speak to his friend the driver,
when a hand was placed on his sleeve, and a child with a dog at
her feet looked up in his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jim!&nbsp; Why, Jim Molyneux!&rdquo; cried Bud.</p>
<h2><a name="page205"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
205</span>CHAPTER XXIV.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">For</span> only a day or two the world (in
a fur-lined collar) dwelt among us, but momentous was its advent
to the household Molyneux came visiting.&nbsp; It was as if a
high tide had swept the dwelling, Bell remarked when he was
gone.&nbsp; You might see no outward difference; the furniture
might still be as it was, and in the same position as Miss Bell
had found it when her mother died, but none the less there was an
unseen doleful wreckage.&nbsp; This unco man Molyneux changed the
vital thing, the atmosphere, and the house with the brass knocker
was never to be altogether just the same again.&nbsp; It is no
discovery of mine that what may seem the smallest trifles play
tremendous parts in destiny.</p>
<p>Even the town itself was some ways altered for a little by the
whim that took the American actor to it.&nbsp; That he should be
American and actor too foredoomed the greatness of his influence,
since the combination stood for much that was mysterious, half
fearful, half sublime, in our simple notions of the larger
world.&nbsp; To have been the first alone would have endowed him
with the charm of wonder and romance for most of us, who, at the
very sight of the name America, even if it be only on a reaper or
a can of beef, have some sense of a mightiness that the roar of
London cannot rouse.&nbsp; But to be an actor too! earning easy
bread by mimicry, and in enormous theatres, before light-headed
folk that have made money&mdash;God knows how!&mdash;and
prospered.&nbsp; Sinful a little, we allow, for there are doubts
if the play-actor, having to paint his face and <a
name="page206"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 206</span>work late
hours in gas-light, finally shall obtain salvation; sinful, and
yet&mdash;and yet&mdash;so queer and clever a way of making out a
living!&nbsp; It is no wonder if we looked on Mr Molyneux with
that regard which by cities is reserved for shahs of a hundred
wives, and royal vagabonds.&nbsp; Besides, consider how the way
had been prepared for him by Bud!&mdash;a child, but a child who
had shown already how wonderful must be the land that had
swallowed up clever men like William Dyce and the brother of P.
&amp; A. MacGlashan.&nbsp; Had she not, by a single object-lesson
in the Pilgrim widow&rsquo;s warehouse, upset the local ways of
commerce, so that now, in all the shops, the people were
constantly buying things of which they had no earthly need; and
the Pilgrim widow herself was put to the weekly trouble of
washing her windows, so wasting time that might have been devoted
to the Mission?&nbsp; Had she not shown that titled ladies were
but human after all, and would not bite you if you cracked a joke
politely with them?&nbsp; Had she not put an end to all the
gallivanting of the maid of Colonsay, and given her an education
that made her fit to court a captain?&nbsp; And, finally, had she
not, by force of sheer example, made dumb and stammering
bashfulness in her fellow pupils at the Sunday-school look
stupid, and by her daily walk and conversation roused in them a
new spirit of inquiry and independence that pleased their parents
not so badly, and only the little twin teachers of the Pigeon
Seminary could mistake for the kind of rebellion that calls for
the application of the tawse?</p>
<p>Mr Molyneux might have no idea of it, but he was a lion for
those few days of sequestration in what he thought the
wilds.&nbsp; Miss Minto dressed her windows specially for his
critical eye, and on the tickets of her autumn sales gave the
name of &ldquo;waist&rdquo; to what had hitherto been a blouse or
a garibaldi; P. &amp; A. MacGlashan made the front of his shop
like a wharf with piles of empty packing-cases to indicate a
prosperous foreign and colonial trade; one morning Wanton Wully
rang the bell at half-past five instead of six to <a
name="page207"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 207</span>prove how
very wide-awake we were; and the band paraded once with a new
tune, &ldquo;Off to Philadelphia,&rdquo; to show that when it
came to gaiety we were not, though small, so very far behind New
York.</p>
<p>But Jim Molyneux, going up and down the street with Lennox and
the dog for cicerones, peered from under the rim of his hat, and
summed all up to himself in the words, &ldquo;Rube town&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Cobwebopolis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bell took warmly to him from the outset, so much was in his
favour.&nbsp; For one thing he was spick and span, though not a
jackanapes, with no long hair about him as she had expected, and
with an honest eye and a good complexion that, for simple country
ladies, readily pass as the guarantee of a being clean
within.&nbsp; She forgave the disreputable part in him&mdash;the
actor, since William had been one, and yet had taught his child
her prayers; and she was willing to overlook the American, seeing
William&rsquo;s wife had suffered from the same misfortune.&nbsp;
But, oh the blow she got when she unpacked what he called his
grip, and found the main thing wanting!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s your Bible, Mr Molyneux?&rdquo; she asked
solemnly.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not in your
portmanteau?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again it was in his favour that he reddened, though the excuse
he had to make was feeble.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear me!&rdquo; she said, shaking her head, with a sad
sort of smile, &ldquo;and you to be so regularly
travelling!&nbsp; If I was your wife I would take you in
hand!&nbsp; But perhaps in America there&rsquo;s no need for a
lamp to the feet and a light to the path.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was after their first supper, for which the patriot Bell
had made a haggis, that her brother, for Molyneux&rsquo;s
information, said was thought to be composed of bagpipes boiled;
Bud was gone to bed in the attic, and Molyneux was telling how he
simply <i>had</i> to come.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my first time in Scotland,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;and when &lsquo;The Iron Hand&rsquo; lost its clutch on
old Edina&rsquo;s fancy, and the scenery was arrested, I
wasn&rsquo;t so sore about it as I might have been, since it gave
me the opportunity of coming up here to see girly-girly.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll <a name="page208"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
208</span>skiddoo from the gang for a day or two,&rsquo; I said
to the manager, when we found ourselves side-tracked, and he said
that was all right, he&rsquo;d wire me when he&rsquo;d fixed a
settlement; so I skiddid, and worked my way here with the aid of
the American language, and a little Scotch&mdash;by
absorption.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have only one fault with your coming&mdash;that it
was not sooner,&rdquo; said Mr Dyce.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m pretty glad I came, if it was only to see
what a credit Bud is to a Scottish training.&nbsp;
Chicago&rsquo;s the finest city on earth&mdash;in spots;
America&rsquo;s what our Fourth of July orators succinctly
designate God&rsquo;s Own, and since Joan of Arc there
hasn&rsquo;t been any woman better or braver than Mrs
Molyneux.&nbsp; But we weren&rsquo;t situated to give Bud a show
like what she&rsquo;d get in a settled home.&nbsp; We did our
best, but we didn&rsquo;t dwell, as you might say, on Michigan
Avenue, and Mrs Molyneux&rsquo;s a dear good girl, but she
isn&rsquo;t demonstratively domesticated.&nbsp; We suspected from
what Bud&rsquo;s father was, the healthiest place she could be
was where he came from, and though we skipped some sleep, both of
us, to think of losing her, now that I&rsquo;m here and see her,
I&rsquo;m glad of it, for my wife and I are pretty much on the
drift most the time in England as we were in the United
States.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yours is an exacting calling, Mr Molyneux,&rdquo; said
Mr Dyce.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very much the same in all
countries, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not so bad as stone-breaking, nor so much of
a cinch as being a statesman,&rdquo; said Mr Molyneux cheerfully,
&ldquo;but a man&rsquo;s pretty old at it before he gives up hope
of breaking out into a very large gun.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve still the
idea myself that if I&rsquo;m not likely to be a Booth or Henry
Irving, I could make a pile at management.&nbsp; With a
millionaire at my back for a mascot, and one strong star, I fancy
I could cut a pretty wide gash through the English dramatic
stage.&nbsp; You know our Mr Emerson said, &lsquo;Hitch your
waggon to a star.&rsquo;&nbsp; I guess if I got a good star
bridled, I&rsquo;d hitch a private parlour-car and a steam yacht
on to <a name="page209"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
209</span>her before she flicked an ear.&nbsp; Who wants a
waggon, anyway?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A waggon&rsquo;s fairly safe to travel in,&rdquo;
suggested Mr Dyce, twinkling through his glasses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So&rsquo;s a hearse,&rdquo; said Mr Molyneux
quickly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Nobody that ever travelled in a hearse
complained of getting his funny-bone jolted or his feelings
jarred, but it&rsquo;s a mighty slow conveyance for live
folks.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the only thing that seems to me to be
wrong with this &rsquo;cute little British Kingdom: it&rsquo;s
pretty, and it&rsquo;s what the school-marm on the coach would
call redolent of the dear dead days beyond recall; and it&rsquo;s
plucky,&mdash;but it keeps the brakes on most the time, and
don&rsquo;t give its star a chance to amble.&nbsp; I guess
it&rsquo;s a fine, friendly, and crowded country to be born rich
in, and a pretty peaceful and lonesome country to die poor in;
but take a tenpenny car-ride out from Charing Cross and
you&rsquo;re in Lullaby Land, and the birds are building nests
and carolling in your whiskers.&nbsp; Life&rsquo;s short; it only
gives a man time to wear through one pair of eyes, two sets of
teeth, and a reputation, and I want to live every hour of it that
I&rsquo;m not conspicuously dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were silent in the parlour of the old house that had for
generations sheltered very different ideals, and over the town
went the call of the wild geese.&nbsp; The room, low-roofed,
small-windowed, papered in dull green, curtained against the
noises of the street, and furnished with the strong mahogany of
Grandma Buntain, dead for sixty years, had ever to those who knew
it best a soul of peace that is not sometimes found in a
cathedral.&nbsp; They felt in it a sanctuary safe from the fret
and tempest, the alarums and disillusions of the life
out-bye.&nbsp; In the light of the shaded lamp hung over the
table, it showed itself to its inmates in the way our most
familiar surroundings will at certain crises&mdash;in an aspect
fonder than ever it had revealed before.&nbsp; To Bell, resenting
the spirit of this actor&rsquo;s gospel, it seemed as if the room
cried out against the sacrilege: even Ailie, sharing in her <a
name="page210"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 210</span>heart, if
less ecstatically, the fervour for life at its busiest this
stranger showed, experienced some inharmony.&nbsp; To Dan it was
for a moment as if he heard a man sell cuckoo clocks by auction
with a tombstone for his rostrum.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr Molyneux,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you remind me, in
what you say, of Maggie White&rsquo;s husband.&nbsp; Before he
died he kept the public-house, and on winter nights when my old
friend Colin Cleland and his cronies would be sitting in the back
room with a good light, a roaring fire, and an argument about
Effectual Calling, so lively that it stopped the effectual and
profitable call for Johnny&rsquo;s toddy, he would come in
chittering as it were with cold, and his coat-collar up on his
neck, to say, &lsquo;An awfu&rsquo; nicht outside!&nbsp; As dark
as the inside o&rsquo; a cow, and as cauld as charity!&nbsp;
They&rsquo;re lucky that have fires to sit by.&rsquo;&nbsp; And
he would impress them so much with the good fortune of their
situation at the time that they would order in another round and
put off their going all the longer, though the night outside, in
truth, was no way out of the ordinary.&nbsp; I feel like that
about this place I was born in, and its old fashions and its lack
of hurry, when I hear you&mdash;with none of Johnny White&rsquo;s
stratagem&mdash;tell us, not how dark and cold is the world
outside, but what to me, at the age of fifty-five, at any rate is
just as unattractive.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll excuse me if, in a
manner of speaking, I ring the bell for another round.&nbsp;
Life&rsquo;s short, as you say, but I don&rsquo;t think it makes
it look any the longer to run through the hours of it instead of
leisurely daundering&mdash;if you happen to know what daundering
is, Mr Molyneux&mdash;and now and then resting on the roadside
with a friend and watching the others pass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At fifty-five,&rdquo; said Mr Molyneux agreeably,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll perhaps think so too, but I can only look at it
from the point of view of thirty-two.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve all got
to move, at first, Mr Dyce.&nbsp; That reminds me of a little
talk I had with Bud to-day.&nbsp; That child&rsquo;s grown, Mr <a
name="page211"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
211</span>Dyce,&mdash;grown a heap of ways: she&rsquo;s hardly a
child any longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tuts!&nbsp; She&rsquo;s nothing else!&rdquo; exclaimed
Miss Bell, with some misgiving.&nbsp; &ldquo;When I was her age I
was still at my sampler in Barbara Mushet&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyhow she&rsquo;s grown.&nbsp; And it seems to me
she&rsquo;s about due for a little fresh experience.&nbsp; I
suppose you&rsquo;ll be thinking of sending her to one of those
Edinburgh schools to have the last coat of shellac put on her
education?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What put that in your head?&nbsp; Did she suggest it
herself?&rdquo; asked Mr Dyce quickly, with his head to one side
in his cross-examination manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, she did,&mdash;but she didn&rsquo;t know
it,&rdquo; said Mr Molyneux.&nbsp; &ldquo;I guess about the very
last thing that child &rsquo;d suggest to anybody would be that
she wanted to separate herself from folk she loves so much as
you; but, if there&rsquo;s one weakness about her, it is that she
can&rsquo;t conceal what she thinks, and I&rsquo;d not been
twenty minutes in her society before I found out she had the
go-fever pretty bad.&nbsp; I suspect a predisposition to that
complaint and a good heart was all her father and mother left
her, and lolling around and dwelling on the past isn&rsquo;t apt
to be her foible.&nbsp; Two or three years in the boarding-school
arena would put the cap sheaf on the making of that girl&rsquo;s
character, and I know, for there&rsquo;s my wife, and she had
only a year and a half.&nbsp; If she&rsquo;d had longer I guess
she&rsquo;d have had more sense than marry me.&nbsp; Bud&rsquo;s
got almost every mortal thing a body wants here, I
suppose,&mdash;love in lumps, a warm moist soil, and all the rest
of it; but she wants to be hardened-off, and for hardening-off a
human flower there&rsquo;s nothing better than a three-course
college, where the social breeze is cooler than it is at
home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Bell turned pale&mdash;the blow had come!&nbsp; Dan
looked at her with a little pity, for he knew she had long been
fearfully expecting it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;and I do not see the
need for any such thing for a long while yet.&nbsp; Do you, <a
name="page212"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
212</span>Ailie?&rdquo;&nbsp; But Ailie had no answer, and that
was enough to show what she thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know how it feels at first to think of her going away
from home,&rdquo; continued Mr Molyneux, eager to be on with a
business he had no great heart for.&nbsp; &ldquo;Bless you, I
know how my wife felt about it,&mdash;she cried like the cherubim
and seraphim.&nbsp; Said it was snatching all the sunshine out of
her life, and when I said, &lsquo;Millicent Molyneux, what about
hubby?&rsquo; she just said &lsquo;Scat!&rsquo; and threw a
couple of agonised throes.&nbsp; Now, Edinburgh&rsquo;s not so
very far away that you&rsquo;d feel desolated if Bud went to a
school there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An unhealthy hole, with haars and horrible east
wind,&rdquo; said Miss Bell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it isn&rsquo;t the Pacific Slope, if it comes to
climate,&rdquo; admitted Mr Molyneux.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but it&rsquo;s the most beautiful city in the wide
world, for all that,&rdquo; cried Miss Bell, with such spirit
that it cleared the air, and made her sister and her brother
smile, for Molyneux, without his knowing it, had touched her in
the very heart&rsquo;s core of her national pride.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re sure you are not mistaken, and that she
would wish to go to school?&rdquo; asked Mr Dyce.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you doubt it yourself?&rdquo; asked Molyneux
slyly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Mr Dyce, &ldquo;I know it well enough,
but&mdash;but I don&rsquo;t believe it,&rdquo; and he smiled at
his own paradox.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have her own words for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then she&rsquo;ll go!&rdquo; said the lawyer firmly, as
if a load was off his mind; and, oddly, there were no objections
from his sisters.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not to imagine, Mr
Molyneux,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;that we have not thought of
this before.&nbsp; It has for months been never out of our minds,
as might be seen from the fact that we never mentioned it, being
loth to take a step that&rsquo;s going to make considerable
difference here.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not that we feared we should
die of ennui in her absence, for we&rsquo;re all philosophers and
have plenty to engage <a name="page213"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 213</span>our minds as well as our activities,
and though you might think us rather rusty here we get a good
deal of fun with ourselves.&nbsp; She&rsquo;ll go&mdash;oh, yes,
of course she&rsquo;ll go,&mdash;Ailie went, and she&rsquo;s
no&rsquo; muckle the waur o&rsquo;t, as we say.&nbsp; I spent
some time in the south myself, and the only harm it seems to have
done me was to make me think too much perhaps of my native
north.&nbsp; Taste&rsquo;s everything, Mr Molyneux, and you may
retort if you please that I&rsquo;m like the other Scotsman who
preferred his apples small and hard and sour.&nbsp; I think
there&rsquo;s no divine instruction, is there, Bell, about
apples? and judgments regarding different countries and different
places in them is mostly a subjective thing, like the estimate of
beauty apart from its utility&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! there you are at your metapheesics, Dan,&rdquo;
cried Miss Bell, &ldquo;and it&rsquo;s for me and Ailie to make
ready the bairn for Edinburgh.&nbsp; She hasna got a stitch
that&rsquo;s fit to be put on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Molyneux stared at her&mdash;the tone displayed so little
opposition to the project; and seeing him so much surprised, the
three of them smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s us!&rdquo; said Mr Dyce.&nbsp;
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re dour and difficult to decide on anything
involving change, and hide from ourselves as long as we can the
need for it; but once our mind&rsquo;s made up, it&rsquo;s
wonderful how we hurry!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bell</span> liked the creature, as I say;
not a little because she saw in him whence came some part of
Bud&rsquo;s jocosity, and most of the daft-like language (though
kind of clever too, she must allow) in which it was
expressed.&nbsp; It was a different kind of jocosity from
Dan&rsquo;s, whose fun, she used to say, partook of the nature of
rowan jelly, being tart and sweet in such a cunning combination
that it tickled every palate and held some natural virtue of the
mountain tree.&nbsp; The fun of Molyneux had another
flavour&mdash;it put her in mind of allspice, being foreign,
having heat as well as savour.&nbsp; But in each of these droll
men was the main thing, as she would aye consider it&mdash;no
distrust of the Creator&rsquo;s judgment, good intentions and
ability, and a readiness to be laughed at as well as find
laughter&rsquo;s cause in others.&nbsp; She liked the man, but
still-and-on was almost glad when the telegram came from
Edinburgh and he went back to join his company.&nbsp; It was not
any lack of hospitality made her feel relief, but the thought
that now Bud&rsquo;s going was determined on, there was so much
to do in a house where men would only be a bother.</p>
<p>Mr Molyneux found himself so much at home among them, he was
loth to go, expressing his contempt for a mode of transit to the
railway that took two hours to nineteen miles; but Bell,
defensive even of her country&rsquo;s coaches, told him he was
haivering,&mdash;that any greater speed than that was simply
tempting Providence.&nbsp; He praised the Lord there was no <a
name="page215"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 215</span>Providence
to be tempted inside Sandy Hook, and that he knew Beef Kings who
hurled themselves across the landscape at the rate of a mile a
minute.&nbsp; The fact inspired no admiration in Miss Bell: she
wondered at the misguided wretches scudding like that regardless
of their lives, and them with so much money.</p>
<p>Before he left he called at the Pigeons&rsquo; Seminary to say
good-bye to the little teachers, and sipped tea,&mdash;a British
institution which he told them was as deleterious as the High
Ball of his native land.&nbsp; High Ball&mdash;what was a High
Ball? asked Miss Amelia, scenting a nice new phrase; but he could
only vaguely indicate that it was something made of rye and
soda.&nbsp; Then she understood&mdash;it was a teetotal drink men
took in clubs, a kind of barley-water.&nbsp; The tea gratified
him less than the confidence of the twins, who told him they had
taken what he said about the&mdash;about the shameful article so
much to heart, that they had given it for a razor-strop to one
George Jordon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bully for you!&rdquo; cried Mr Molyneux
delighted.&nbsp; &ldquo;But I&rsquo;d have liked that tawse some,
myself, for my wife&rsquo;s mighty keen on curios.&nbsp;
She&rsquo;s got a sitting-room full of Navaho things:
scalpin&rsquo;-knives, tomahawks, and other brutal bric-a-brac,
and an early British strap would tickle her to death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well, he was gone: the coachman&rsquo;s horn had scarcely
ceased to echo beyond the arches, when Miss Bell had thrown
herself into the task of preparing for Bud&rsquo;s change in
life.</p>
<p>What school was she to go to in Edinburgh?&mdash;Ailie knew:
there was none better than the one she had gone to herself.</p>
<p>When did it open?&mdash;Ailie knew: in a fortnight.</p>
<p>What, exactly, would she need?&mdash;Ailie knew that too: she
had in the escritoire a list of things made up already.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems to me,&rdquo; said Miss Bell suspiciously,
&ldquo;you&rsquo;re desperately well informed on all that
appertains to this sudden necessity.&nbsp; How long has it been
in your mind?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page216"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
216</span>&ldquo;For a twelvemonth at least,&rdquo; answered
Ailie boldly.&nbsp; &ldquo;How long has it been in your
own?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m!&rdquo; said Bell.&nbsp; &ldquo;About as
long, but I refused to harbour it; and&mdash;and now that the
thing&rsquo;s decided on, Ailie Dyce, I hope you&rsquo;re not
going to stand there arguing away about it all day long, when
there&rsquo;s so much to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Surely there was never another house so throng, so bustling,
so feverish in anxiety, as this one was for the next
fortnight.&nbsp; The upper and the lower Dyce Academy took
holiday; Kate&rsquo;s education stopped with a sudden gasp at a
dreadful hill called Popocatepetl, and she said she did not care
a button, since Captain Maclean (no longer Charles to any one
except himself and Bud in the more confidential moments) said the
main things needed in a sailor&rsquo;s wife were health, hope,
and temper and a few good-laying hens.&nbsp; Miss Minto was
engaged upon Bud&rsquo;s grandest garments, running out and in
next door herself with inch-tapes over her shoulders and a
mouthful of pins, and banging up against the lawyer in his lobby
to her great distress of mind.&nbsp; And Bell had in the
seamstress, &rsquo;Lizbeth Ann, to help her and Ailie with the
rest.&nbsp; Mercator sulked neglected on the wall of Mr
Dyce&rsquo;s study, which was strewn with basting-threads and
snippets of selvedge and lining till it looked like a
tailor&rsquo;s shop, and Bud and Footles played on the floor of
it with that content which neither youth nor dogs can find in
chambers trim and orderly.&nbsp; Even Kate was called in to help
these hurried operations&mdash;they termed it the making of
Bud&rsquo;s trousseau.&nbsp; In the garden birds were calling,
calling; far sweeter in the women&rsquo;s ears were the snip-snip
of scissors and the whir of the sewing-machine; needle arms went
back and forth like fiddle-bows in an orchestra, and from webs of
cloth and linen came forth garments whose variety intoxicated her
who was to wear them.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m thinking Daniel Dyce lived
simply then, with rather makeshift dinners, but I&rsquo;m
certain, knowing him well, he did not care, since his share in
the great <a name="page217"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
217</span>adventure was to correspond with Edinburgh, and pave
the way there for the young adventurer&rsquo;s invasion.</p>
<p>He would keek in at the door on them as he passed to his
office, and Ailie would cry, &ldquo;Avaunt, man! here woman
reigns.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a pleasant change,&rdquo; he would
say.&nbsp; &ldquo;I would sooner have them rain than
storm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re as bad as Geordie Jordon,&rdquo; said Miss
Bell, biting thread with that zest which always makes me think
her sex at some time must have lived on
cotton,&mdash;&ldquo;you&rsquo;re as bad as Geordie Jordon, you
cannot see a keyhole but your eye begins to water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If it had indeed been Bud&rsquo;s trousseau, the town folk
could not have displayed more interest.&nbsp; Ladies came each
day to see how things progressed, and recommend a heavier lining
or another row of the insertion.&nbsp; Even Lady Anne came one
afternoon to see the trousseau, being interested, as she slyly
said, in such things for private reasons of her own, and dubious
about the rival claims of ivory or pure white.&nbsp; So she said;
but she came, no doubt, to assure Miss Lennox that her captain
was a great success.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew he&rsquo;d be!&rdquo; said Bud
complacently.&nbsp; &ldquo;That man&rsquo;s so beautiful and
good, he&rsquo;s fit for the Kingdom of Heaven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So are you&mdash;you rogue!&rdquo; said Lady Anne,
gathering her in her arms, without a bit of awkwardness, to the
great astonishment of &rsquo;Lizbeth Ann, who thought that titled
folk were not a bit like that&mdash;perhaps had not the proper
sort of arms for it.&nbsp; Yes, &ldquo;So are you&mdash;you
rogue!&rdquo; said Lady Anne.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;m not,&rdquo; said the child.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Leastways only sometimes.&nbsp; Most the time I&rsquo;m a
born limb, but then again I&rsquo;m nearly always trying to be
better, and that&rsquo;s what counts, I guess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;re going away to leave us,&rdquo; said
Lady Anne, whereon a strange thing happened, for the joyous
child, who was to get her heart&rsquo;s desire and such lovely
garments, burst into tears, and ran from <a
name="page218"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 218</span>the room to
hide herself upstairs in the attic bower, whose windows looked to
a highway that seemed hateful through her tears.&nbsp; Her
ladyship went off distressed, but Bell, as one rejoicing, said,
&ldquo;I always told you, Ailie&mdash;William&rsquo;s
heart!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Bud&rsquo;s tears were transient: she was soon back among
the snippets where Ailie briskly plied the sewing-machine, and
sang the kind of cheerful songs that alone will go to the time of
pedalling, and so give proof that the age of mechanism is the
merry age, if we have the happy ear for music.&nbsp; And Bud,
though she tired so soon of hems, could help another way that
busy convocation, for she could sit tucked up in Uncle
Dan&rsquo;s snoozing chair and read &lsquo;Pickwick&rsquo; to the
women till the maid of Colonsay was in the mood to take the
Bardell body by the hair of the head and shake her for her
brazenness to the poor wee man.&nbsp; Or the child would dance as
taught by the lady of the Vaudeville, or start at Ailie&rsquo;s
bidding (Bell a little dubious) to declaim a bit of
&ldquo;Hamlet&rdquo; or &ldquo;Macbeth,&rdquo; till
&rsquo;Lizbeth Ann saw ghosts and let her nerves get the better
of her, and there was nothing for it but a cheery cup of tea all
round.&nbsp; Indeed, I must confess, a somewhat common
company!&nbsp; I could almost wish for the sake of my story they
were more genteel, and dined at half-past seven, and talked in
low hushed tones of Bach and Botticelli.</p>
<p>But, oh! they were happy days&mdash;at least, so far as all
outward symptoms went: it might indeed have been a real
trousseau, and not the garments for the wedding of a maiden and
the world.&nbsp; How often in the later years did Winifred
Wallace, reading to me her own applause in newspapers, stop to
sigh and tell me how she once was really happy&mdash;happy to the
inward core, feeling the dumb applause of four women in a country
chamber, when the world was all before her, and her heart was
young.</p>
<h2><a name="page219"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
219</span>CHAPTER XXVI.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Working</span> thus, furiously, at the
task of love, which, in all it does for the youth it cherishes,
must ever be digging a grave for its own delight, Bell could
forget, for periods, that the days of Bud&rsquo;s presence in
their midst were numbered.&nbsp; Had she stopped her needle and
shears a moment, and let her mind contemplate all the emptiness
of a fortnight hence and the months and years thereafter, she
would have broken down.&nbsp; Ailie, knowing it, watched her
anxiously, and kept the sewing briskly going as if they wrought
for a living in a factory, frightened to think of her
sister&rsquo;s desperate state when that last button, that the
Armies talk about, was in its place.</p>
<p>But the days sped: one afternoon there was a final sweeping up
of the scraps in the temporary workroom, Bell searched her mind
in vain to think of anything further wanted, and, though there
were still two weeks to go, became appalled to find that the only
thing of any moment to be done &rsquo;twixt now and Friday
fortnight was to say Good-bye!</p>
<p>No, stay!&nbsp; There was another thing to bring a little
respite&mdash;the girl&rsquo;s initials must be sewn upon her
clothing.&nbsp; A trivial thing to mention, you may think, but
the very thought of it gave pleasure to the sisters, till Bud
herself, sent to Miss Minto&rsquo;s for a sample of the woven
letters, came back with only one&mdash;it was a W.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has the stupid body not got L&rsquo;s and
D&rsquo;s?&rdquo; asked Bell.&nbsp; &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no use
here for W.&rdquo;&nbsp; And Bud showed a countenance startled
and ashamed.</p>
<p><a name="page220"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
220</span>&ldquo;Oh, Auntie!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;I asked for
W&rsquo;s.&nbsp; I quite forgot my name was Lennox Dyce, for in
all I&rsquo;m thinking of about the school and Edinburgh, I am
Winifred Wallace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was all that was needed to bring about her aunt&rsquo;s
prostration!&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m far from well,&rdquo; said
she, and took to her bed, her first confession of weakness in all
the years that Dan or Ailie could remember.&nbsp; What ailed her
she could not tell, and they sent, without acquainting her, for
Dr Brash.&nbsp; Hearing he was coming, she protested that she
could not see the man&mdash;that she was far too ill to be
troubled by any doctor; but Dr Brash was not so easily to be
denied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m!&rdquo; said he, examining her.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Your system&rsquo;s badly down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never knew I had one,&rdquo; said the lady, smiling
wanly, with a touch of Dan&rsquo;s rowan-jelly humour.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Women had no system in my young days to go up or down: if
they had, they were ashamed to mention it.&nbsp; Nowadays, it
seems as fashionable as what Kate, since she got her education,
calls the boil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have been worrying,&rdquo; he went
on,&mdash;&ldquo;a thing that&rsquo;s dreadfully
injudicious.&nbsp; H&rsquo;m! worse than drink, <i>I</i>
say.&nbsp; Worry&rsquo;s the death of half my patients; they
never give my pills a chance,&rdquo; and there was a twinkle in
his eyes which most of Dr Brash&rsquo;s patients thought was far
more efficacious than his pills.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What would I worry for?&rdquo; said Miss Bell.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I have every blessing; goodness and mercy
all my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just so! just so!&rdquo; said Dr Brash.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Goodness and&mdash;and, h&rsquo;m&mdash;mercy sometimes
take the form of a warning that it&rsquo;s time we kept to bed
for a week, and that&rsquo;s what I recommend you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mercy on me!&nbsp; Am I so far through as that?&rdquo;
she said, alarmed.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s something
serious,&mdash;I know by the cheerful face that you put on
you.&nbsp; Little did I think that I would drop off so
soon.&nbsp; And just at the very time when there&rsquo;s so much
to do!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pooh!&rdquo; said Dr Brash.&nbsp; &ldquo;When you drop
off, <a name="page221"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
221</span>Miss Dyce, there&rsquo;ll be an awful dunt, I&rsquo;m
telling you!&nbsp; God bless my soul, what do you think a
doctor&rsquo;s for but putting folk on their pins again!&nbsp; A
week in bed&mdash;and&mdash;h&rsquo;m!&mdash;a bottle.&nbsp;
Everything&rsquo;s in the bottle, mind you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And there&rsquo;s the hands of the Almighty too,&rdquo;
said Bell, who constantly deplored the doctor was so poor a Kirk
attender, and not a bit in that respect like the noble doctors in
her sister&rsquo;s latest Scottish novels.</p>
<p>Dr Brash went out of the room, to find the rest of the
household sorely put about in the parlour, Lennox an object of
woe, and praying hard to herself with as much as she could
remember of her Uncle Dan&rsquo;s successful supplication for
herself when she had the pneumonia.&nbsp; To see the cheerfulness
of his countenance when he came in was like the sun-burst on a
leaden sea.&nbsp; &ldquo;Miss Bell&rsquo;s as sound as her
namesake,&rdquo; he assured them.&nbsp; &ldquo;There&rsquo;s been
something on her mind&rdquo;&mdash;with a flash of the eye, at
once arrested, towards Lennox,&mdash;&ldquo;and she has worked
herself into a state of nervous collapse.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve given
her the best of tonics for her kind,&mdash;the dread of a week in
bed,&mdash;and I&rsquo;ll wager she&rsquo;ll be up by
Saturday.&nbsp; The main thing is to keep her cheerful, and I
don&rsquo;t think that should be very difficult.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bud there and then made up her mind that her own true love was
Dr Brash, in spite of his nervous sisters and his funny
waistcoats.&nbsp; Ailie said if cheerfulness would do the thing
she was ready for laughing-gas, and the lawyer vowed he would
rake the town for the very latest chronicles of its never-ending
fun.</p>
<p>But Bud was long before him on her mission of cheerfulness to
the bedroom of Auntie Bell.&nbsp; Did you ever see a douce Scotch
lass who never in her life had harboured the idea that her native
hamlet was other than the finest dwelling-place in all the world,
and would be happy never to put a foot outside it?&mdash;that was
to be the <i>r&ocirc;le</i> to-day.&nbsp; A sober little lass,
sitting in a wicker-chair whose faintest creak appeared to put <a
name="page222"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 222</span>her in an
agony&mdash;sitting incredibly long and still, and speaking
Scotch when spoken to, in the most careful undertone, with a
particular kind of smile that was her idea of judicious
cheerfulness for a sick-room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bairn!&rdquo; cried her aunt at last, &ldquo;if you sit
much longer like that you&rsquo;ll drive me crazy.&nbsp; What in
the world&rsquo;s the matter with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing, dear Auntie Bell,&rdquo; said Bud,
astonished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t tell me!&nbsp; What was the Doctor
saying?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said you were to be kept cheerful,&rdquo; said Bud,
&ldquo;and I&rsquo;m doing the best I can&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bless me, lass! do you think it&rsquo;s cheery to be
sitting there with a face like a Geneva watch?&nbsp; I would
sooner see you romping.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But no, Bud could not romp that day, and when her Uncle Dan
came up he found her reading aloud from Bell&rsquo;s favourite
Gospel according to John&mdash;her auntie&rsquo;s way of securing
the cheerfulness required.&nbsp; He looked at the pair, his hands
in his pockets, his shoulders bent, and all the joviality with
which he had come carefully charged gave place for a little to a
graver sentiment.&nbsp; So had Ailie sat, a child, beside her
mother on her death-bed, and, reading John one day, found open
some new vista in her mind that made her there and then renounce
her dearest visions, and thirl herself for ever to the home and
him and Bell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Dan,&rdquo; said his sister, when the child was
gone, &ldquo;what have you brought me?&nbsp; Is it the usual
pound of grapes?&rdquo;&mdash;for she was of the kind whose most
pious exercises never quench their sense of fun, and a gift of
grapes in our place is a doleful hint to folks bedridden: I think
they sometimes might as well bring in the stretching-board.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A song-book would suit you better,&rdquo; said the
lawyer.&nbsp; &ldquo;What do you think&rsquo;s the matter with
you?&nbsp; Worrying about that wean!&nbsp; Is this your Christian
resignation?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am <i>not</i> worrying, Dan,&rdquo; she
protested.&nbsp; &ldquo;At <a name="page223"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 223</span>least, not very much, and I never
was the one to make much noise about my Christianity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You need to be pretty noisy with it nowadays to make
folk believe you mean it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did Dr Brash say down the stair?&rdquo; she
asked.&nbsp; &ldquo;Does he&mdash;does he think I&rsquo;m going
to die?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord bless me!&rdquo; cried her brother, &ldquo;this is
not the way that women die.&nbsp; I never heard of you having a
broken heart.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re missing all the usual
preliminaries, and you haven&rsquo;t even practised being
ill.&nbsp; No, no, Bell; it&rsquo;ll be many a day, I hope,
before you&rsquo;re pushing up the daisies, as that vagabond
Wanton Wully puts it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bell sighed.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;re very
joco&rsquo;,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;you&rsquo;re aye cheery,
whatever happens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So long as it doesn&rsquo;t happen to
myself&mdash;that&rsquo;s philosophy; at least it&rsquo;s Captain
Consequence&rsquo;s.&nbsp; And if I&rsquo;m cheery to-day
it&rsquo;s by the Doctor&rsquo;s orders.&nbsp; He says
you&rsquo;re to be kept from fretting, even if we have to hire
the band.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I doubt I&rsquo;m far far through!&rdquo; said
Bell; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m booked for a better land,&rdquo;&mdash;and
at that the lawyer gave a chirruping little laugh, and said,
&ldquo;Are you sure it&rsquo;s not for Brisbane?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; she asked him, marvellously
interested for one who talked of dying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a new one,&rdquo; he exclaimed.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I had it to-day from her ladyship&rsquo;s Captain.&nbsp;
He was once on a ship that sailed to Australia, and half-way out
a passenger took very ill.&nbsp; &lsquo;That one&rsquo;s booked
for heaven, anyway,&rsquo; Maclean said to the purser.&nbsp;
&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said the purser, who was busy,
&lsquo;he&rsquo;s booked for Brisbane.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Then
he would be a D. sight better in heaven,&rsquo; said Maclean;
&lsquo;I have been twice in Brisbane, and I
know.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bell did her best to restrain a smile, but
couldn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, Dan!&rdquo; said she,
&ldquo;you&rsquo;re an awful man!&nbsp; You think there&rsquo;s
nothing in this world to daunten anybody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not if they happen to be Dyces,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp;
&ldquo;A high heart and a humble head&mdash;you remember <a
name="page224"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
224</span>father&rsquo;s motto?&nbsp; And here you&rsquo;re
dauntened because the young one&rsquo;s going only one or two
hundred miles away for her own advantage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a bit dauntened,&rdquo; said Miss Bell
with spirit.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not myself I&rsquo;m
thinking of at all&mdash;it&rsquo;s her, poor thing! among
strangers night and day; damp sheets, maybe, and not a wise-like
thing to eat.&nbsp; You would never forgive yourself if she fell
into a decline.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ailie throve pretty well on their dieting,&rdquo; he
pointed out; &ldquo;and if she&rsquo;s going to fall into a
decline, she&rsquo;s pretty long of starting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you mind they gave her sago pudding,&rdquo; said
Miss Bell; &ldquo;and if there&rsquo;s one thing Lennox cannot
eat, it&rsquo;s sago pudding.&nbsp; She says it is so slippy,
every spoonful disappears so sudden it gives her an awful
start.&nbsp; She says she might as well sup puddocks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan smiled at the picture and forced himself to silent
patience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And they&rsquo;ll maybe let her sit up to all
hours,&rdquo; Bell proceeded.&nbsp; &ldquo;You know the way she
fastens on a book at bed-time!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well!&rdquo; said he emphatically.&nbsp;
&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re sure that things are to be so bad as that,
we&rsquo;ll not let her go at all,&rdquo; and he slyly scanned
her countenance to see, as he expected, that she was indignant at
the very thought of backing out now that they had gone so
far.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t start to talk nonsense,&rdquo; said
she; &ldquo;of course she&rsquo;s going.&nbsp; But oh, Dan!
it&rsquo;s not the sheets, nor food, nor anything like that, that
troubles me; it&rsquo;s the knowledge that she&rsquo;ll never be
the same wee lass again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tuts!&rdquo; said Daniel Dyce, and cleaned some
moisture from his spectacles; &ldquo;you&rsquo;re putting all the
cheerful things I was going to say to you out of my head.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m off to business; is there anything I can do for
you?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; Then, remember, you&rsquo;re not to stir
this week outside the blankets; these are the orders of Dr
Brash.&nbsp; I have no doubt Ailie will do <a
name="page225"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 225</span>very well
at the house-keeping,&rdquo; and he left her with a gleam of
mischief in his eye.</p>
<p>The window of the bedroom was a little open; on one of the
trees a blackbird sang, and there came in the scent of
apple-ringie and a tempting splendour of sun.&nbsp; For twenty
minutes the ailing lady tried to content herself with the thought
of a household managed by Alison Dyce, and then arose to see if
Wully Oliver was not idling in the garden.&nbsp; She saw him
sitting on his barrow-trams, while Ailie walked among the
dahlias, and chucked her favourites of them under their
chins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;William Oliver!&rdquo; cried Miss Bell indignantly,
having thrown a Shetland shawl about her; &ldquo;is that all the
work you can do in a day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked up at the window and slowly put his pipe in his
pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, m&rsquo;em,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I daresay I
could do more, but I never was much of a hand for showing
off.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page226"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
226</span>CHAPTER XXVII.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Miss Bell rose, as she did in
a day or two, bantered into a speedy convalescence by Ailie and
Dan, it was to mark Bud&rsquo;s future holidays on the calendar,
and count the months in such a cunning way that she cheated the
year of a whole one, by arguing to herself that the child would
be gone a fortnight before they really missed her, and as good as
home again whenever she started packing to return.&nbsp; And
Edinburgh, when one was reasonable and came to think of it, was
not so very awful: the Miss Birds were there, in the next street
to the school where Bud was bound for, so if anything should
happen,&mdash;a fire, for instance&mdash;fires were desperately
common just now in the newspapers, and ordinary commonsense
suggested a whole clothes-rope for the tying up of the young
adventurer&rsquo;s boxes; or if Bud should happen to be really
hungry between her usual meals&mdash;a common thing with growing
bairns,&mdash;the Birds were the very ones to make her
welcome.&nbsp; It was many a year since Bell had been in
Edinburgh,&mdash;she had not been there since mother
died,&mdash;she was determined that, if she had the money and was
spared till Martinmas, she should make a jaunt of it and see the
shops: it was very doubtful if Miss Minto wasn&rsquo;t often
lamentably out of date with many of her fashions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you vain woman!&rdquo; cried Ailie to her;
&ldquo;will nothing but the very latest satisfy you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bud was to be sure and write once every week, on any day but
Saturday, for if her letters came on <a name="page227"></a><span

at the post-office for them, like Captain Consequence, instead of
waiting till the Monday morning.&nbsp; And if she had a cold or
any threatening of quinsy, she was to fly for her very life to
the hoarhound mixture, put a stocking round her neck, and go to
bed.&nbsp; Above all, was she to mind and take her porridge every
morning, and to say her prayers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take porridge to beat the band,&rdquo; Bud
promised, &ldquo;even&mdash;even if I have to shut my eyes all
through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a cautious moderation,&rdquo; recommended Uncle
Dan.&nbsp; &ldquo;I think myself oatmeal is far too rich a diet
for the blood.&nbsp; I have it from Captain Consequence that
there&rsquo;s nothing for breakfast like curried kidney and a
chop to follow.&nbsp; But I hope you&rsquo;ll understand that,
apart from the carnal appetites, the main thing is to scoop in
all the prizes.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll be dreadfully disappointed if
you come back disgraced, with anything less of them than the full
of a cart.&nbsp; That, I believe, is the only proof of a liberal
Scottish education.&nbsp; In Ailie&rsquo;s story-books it&rsquo;s
all the good, industrious, and deserving pupils who get
everything.&nbsp; Of course, if you take all the prizes
somebody&rsquo;s sure to want,&mdash;but, tuts! I would never let
that consideration vex me&mdash;it&rsquo;s their own
look-out.&nbsp; If you don&rsquo;t take prizes, either in the
school or in the open competition of the world, how are folk to
know they should respect you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must have been a wonderfully successful student in
your day,&rdquo; said Ailie mischievously.&nbsp; &ldquo;Where are
all your medals?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan laughed.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s ill to say,&rdquo; said
he, &ldquo;for the clever lads who won them when I wasn&rsquo;t
looking have been so modest ever since that they&rsquo;ve clean
dropped out of sight.&nbsp; I never won anything myself in all my
life that called for competition&mdash;except the bottom of the
class!&nbsp; When it came to competitions, and I could see the
other fellows&rsquo; faces, I was always far too tired or well
disposed to them to give them a disappointment which they
seemingly couldn&rsquo;t stand so well as myself.&nbsp; But then
I&rsquo;m not like Bud here.&nbsp; <a name="page228"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 228</span>I hadn&rsquo;t a shrewd old uncle
egging me on.&nbsp; So you must be keen on the prizes, Bud.&nbsp;
Of course there&rsquo;s wisdom too, but that comes
later,&mdash;there&rsquo;s no hurry for it.&nbsp; Prizes,
prizes&mdash;remember the prizes: the more you win, the more, I
suppose, I&rsquo;ll admire you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if I don&rsquo;t win any, Uncle Dan?&rdquo; said
Bud slyly, knowing very well the nature of his fun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, I suppose, I&rsquo;ll have to praise the Lord if
you keep your health, and just continue loving you,&rdquo; said
the lawyer.&nbsp; &ldquo;I admit that if you&rsquo;re anyway
addicted to the prizes, you&rsquo;ll be the first of your name
that was so.&nbsp; In that same school in Edinburgh your Auntie
Ailie&rsquo;s quarterly reports had always
&lsquo;Conduct&mdash;Good,&rsquo; and
&lsquo;Mathematics&mdash;Fairly moderate.&rsquo;&nbsp; We half
expected she was coming back an awful dilly; but if she did, she
made a secret of it.&nbsp; I forgave her the &lsquo;Fairly
moderate&rsquo; myself, seeing she had learned one
thing&mdash;how to sing.&nbsp; I hope you&rsquo;ll learn to sing,
Bud, in French, or German, or Italian&mdash;anything but
Scotch.&nbsp; Our old Scotch songs, I&rsquo;m told, are not
what&rsquo;s called artistic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sweetest in the world!&rdquo; cried Auntie
Bell.&nbsp; &ldquo;I wonder to hear you haivering.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;re not a judge of
music,&rdquo; said the brother.&nbsp; &ldquo;Scotch songs are
very common&mdash;everybody knows them.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s no
art in them, there&rsquo;s only heart&mdash;a trifling kind of
quality.&nbsp; If you happen to hear me singing &lsquo;Annie
Laurie&rsquo; or &lsquo;Afton Water&rsquo; after you come home,
Bud, be sure and check me.&nbsp; I want to be no discredit to
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I shan&rsquo;t, Uncle Dan,&rdquo; said the
child.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll sing &lsquo;Mary Morison,&rsquo;
and &lsquo;Ae Fond Kiss,&rsquo; and &lsquo;Jock o&rsquo;
Hazeldean&rsquo; at you till you&rsquo;re fairly squealing with
delight.&nbsp; I know.&nbsp; Allow me! why, you&rsquo;re only
haivering.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have mercy on the child, Dan,&rdquo; said his
sister.&nbsp; &ldquo;Never you mind him, Bud; he&rsquo;s only
making fun of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; said Bud; &ldquo;but I&rsquo;m not
kicking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Kate&mdash;ah! poor Kate&mdash;how sorry I should be for <a
name="page229"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 229</span>her,
deserted by her friend and tutor, if she had not her own
consoling Captain.&nbsp; Kate would be weeping silently every
time the pipe was on in the scullery, and she thought how lonely
her kitchen was to be when the child was gone.&nbsp; And she had
plans to make that painful exile less heartrending: she was going
to write to her sister out in Colonsay and tell her to be sure
and send fresh country eggs at intervals of every now and then,
or maybe oftener in the winter-time, to Lennox; for the genuine
country egg was a thing it was hopeless to expect in Edinburgh,
where there wasn&rsquo;t such a thing as sand, or grass, or
heather&mdash;only causeway stones.&nbsp; She could assure Lennox
that, as for marriage, there was not the slightest risk for years
and years, since there wasn&rsquo;t a house in the town to let
that would be big enough (and still not dear) to suit a
Captain.&nbsp; He was quite content to be a plain intended, and
hold on.&nbsp; And as for writing, she would take her pen in hand
quite often and send the latest news to Lennox, who must please
excuse haste, and these d-d-desperate pens, and having the post
to catch&mdash;not that she would dream of catching the poor,
wee, shauchly creature: it was just a way of speaking.&nbsp;
Would Lennox not be dreadful home-sick, missing all the cheery
things, and smothered up in books in yon
place&mdash;Edinburgh?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I expect I&rsquo;ll be dre&rsquo;ffle home-sick,&rdquo;
admitted Bud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you will, my lassie,&rdquo; said the
maid.&nbsp; &ldquo;I was so home-sick myself when I came here at
first that my feet got almost splay with wanting to turn back to
Colonsay.&nbsp; But if I&rsquo;m not so terribly good-looking,
I&rsquo;m awful brave, and soon got over it.&nbsp; When you are
home-sick go down to the quay and look at the steamboats, or take
a turn at our old friend Mr Puckwuck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Four days&mdash;three days&mdash;two days&mdash;one
day&mdash;to-morrow; that last day went so fast, it looked as if
Wanton Wully had lost the place again and rang the evening bell
some hours before it was due.&nbsp; Bud could only sit by,
helpless, and marvel at the <a name="page230"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 230</span>ingenuity that could be shown in
packing what looked enough to stock Miss Minto&rsquo;s shop into
a couple of boxes.&nbsp; She aged a twelvemonth between the
hand-glass at the bottom and the bath-sheet on the top.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And in this corner,&rdquo; said Miss Bell, on her
knees, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll find your Bible, the hoarhound
mixture, and five-and-twenty threepenny-bits for the plate on
Sundays.&nbsp; Some of them sixpences.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Irish ones, apparently,&rdquo; said Uncle Dan.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some of them sixpences, for the Foreign Mission days,
and one shilling for the day of the Highlands and
Islands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re well provided for the kirk at any
rate,&rdquo; said Uncle Dan.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to put
a little money for this wicked world in the other corner,&rdquo;
and he did.</p>
<p>When the coach next day set out&mdash;No, no, I cannot tell
you all, for I hate to think of tears, and would hurry over
partings.&nbsp; It went in tearful weather, rain drizzling on Bud
and Auntie Ailie, who accompanied her.&nbsp; They looked back on
the hill-top, and saw the grey slates glint under a grey sky, and
following them on the miry road, poor Footles, faithful heart,
who did not understand.&nbsp; He paddled through the mud till a
blast from the bugle startled him, and he seemed to realise that
this was some painful new experience.&nbsp; And then he stood in
the track of the disappearing wheels, and lifted up his voice in
lamentation.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The night came on, resuming her ancient empire&mdash;for she
alone, and not the day, did first possess and finally shall
possess unquestioned this space dusty with transient stars, and
the light is Lord of another universe where is no night, nay, nor
terror thereof.&nbsp; From the western clouds were the flame and
gold withdrawn, and the winds sighed from the mountains, as vexed
for passing days.&nbsp; The winds sighed from the mountains, and
the mists came mustering to the glens; the sea crept out on long,
bird-haunted, <a name="page231"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
231</span>wailing, and piping sands, nought to be seen of it, its
presence obvious only in the scent of wrack and the wash on the
pebbled beaches.&nbsp; Behind the town the woods lay black and
haunted, and through them, and far upward in the valley, dripping
in the rain and clamorous with hidden burns and secret wells,
went the highway to the world, vacant of aught visible, but never
to be wholly vacant, since whoso passes on a highway ever after
leaves some wandering spirit there.&nbsp; Did the child, that
night, think of the highway that had carried her from home?&nbsp;
In the hoarsely crying city did she pause a moment to remember
and retrace her way to the little town that now lay faintly
glowing in the light of its own internal fires?</p>
<p>Thus Bell wondered, standing at her window, looking into the
solitary street.&nbsp; Every mile of separating highway rose
before her,&mdash;she walked them in the rain and dark; all the
weary longing of the world came down on her that mirk night in
September, and praying that discretion should preserve and
understanding keep her wanderer, she arrived at the soul&rsquo;s
tranquillity, and heard without misgiving the wild geese cry.</p>
<p>Her brother took the Books, and the three of
them&mdash;master, mistress, and maid&mdash;were one in the
spirit of worship, longing, and hope.&nbsp; Where, then, I
wonder, had gone Daniel Dyce, the lawyer, the gentle ironist, on
whose lips so often was kindly mockery, on whose tongue levity or
its pretence&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Never by passion quite
possess&rsquo;d,<br />
And never quite benumbed by the world&rsquo;s sway&rdquo;?</p>
<p>It was Bell&rsquo;s nightly duty to turn the lamp out in the
lobby and bolt the outer door.&nbsp; She went this night
reluctant to perform that office, but a thought possessed her of
a child from home, somewhere in the darkness among strangers, and
she had to call her brother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p><a name="page232"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
232</span>&ldquo;The door,&rdquo; she said, ashamed of herself,
&ldquo;I cannot bolt it,&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked at her flushed face and her trembling hand, and
understood.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only the door of a
house,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;<i>that</i> makes no
difference,&rdquo; and ran the bolt into its staple.</p>
<h2><a name="page233"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
233</span>CHAPTER XXVIII.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">For</span> all the regrets of increasing
age there is one alleviation among many, that days apart from
those we love pass the quicker, even as our hurrying years.&nbsp;
Thus it is that separations are divested of more and more of
their terrors the nearer we are to that final parting which wipes
out all, and is but the going to a great reunion.&nbsp; So the
first fortnight, whereof Miss Bell thought to cheat the almanac
under the delusion that Bud&rsquo;s absence would then scarcely
be appreciated, was in truth the period when she missed her most,
and the girl was back for her Christmas holidays before half of
her threepenny-bits for the plate were done.</p>
<p>It was worth a year of separation to see her come in at the
door, rosy from the frosty air, with sparkling eyes and the old,
sweet, rippling laugh, not&mdash;outside at least&mdash;an atom
different from the girl who had gone away; and it made up to Bud
herself for many evenings home-sick on an Edinburgh pillow to
smell again the old celestial Christmas grocery and feel the
warmth of her welcome.</p>
<p>Myself, I like to be important&mdash;not of such consequence
to the world as to have it crick its neck with having to look up
at me, but now and then important only to a few old friends; and
Bud, likewise, could always enjoy the upper seat, if the others
of her company were never below the salt.&nbsp; She basked in the
flattery that Kate&rsquo;s deportment gave to her dignity as a
young lady educated at tremendous cost.</p>
<p>It was the daft days of her first coming over again; <a
name="page234"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 234</span>but this
time she saw all with older eyes,&mdash;and, besides, the novelty
of the little Scottish town was ended.&nbsp; Wanton Wully&rsquo;s
bell, pealing far beyond the burgh bounds,&mdash;commanding, like
the very voice of God, to every ear of that community, no matter
whether it rang at morn or eve,&mdash;gave her at once a crystal
notion of the smallness of the place, not only in its bounds of
stone and mortar, but in its interests, as compared with the
city, where a thousand bells, canorous on the Sabbath, failed, it
was said, to reach the ears of more than a fraction of the
people.&nbsp; The bell, and John Taggart&rsquo;s band on
Hogmanay, and the little shops with windows falling back already
on timid appeals, and the grey high tenements pierced by narrow
entries, and the douce and decent humdrum folk,&mdash;she saw
them with a more exacting vision, and Ailie laughed to hear them
all summed up as &ldquo;quaint.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wondered when you would reach
&lsquo;quaint,&rsquo;&rdquo; said Auntie Ailie; &ldquo;it was due
some time ago, but this is a house where you never hear the
word.&nbsp; Had you remained at the Pige&mdash; at the Misses
Duff&rsquo;s Seminary Miss Amelia would have had you sewing it on
samplers, if samplers any longer were the fashion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it not a nice word &lsquo;quaint&rsquo;?&rdquo;
asked Bud, who, in four months among critics less tolerant (and
perhaps less wise) than the Dyces, had been compelled to rid
herself of many transatlantic terms and phrases.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with &lsquo;quaint,&rsquo;
my dear,&rdquo; said Miss Ailie; &ldquo;it moves in the most
exclusive circles: if I noticed it particularly, it is because it
is the indication of a certain state of mind, and tells me where
you stand in your education more clearly than your first
quarterly report.&nbsp; I came home from school with
&lsquo;quaint&rsquo; myself: it not only seemed to save a lot of
trouble by being a word which could be applied to anything not
otherwise describable, but I cherished it because its use
conferred on me a kind of inward glow of satisfaction
like&mdash;like&mdash;like Aunt Bell&rsquo;s <a
name="page235"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 235</span>home-made
ginger-cordial.&nbsp; &lsquo;Quaint,&rsquo; Bud, is the
shibboleth of boarding-school culture: when you can use the word
in the proper place, with a sense of superiority to the thing so
designated, you are practically a young lady and the polish is
taking on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They all say it in our school,&rdquo; explained Bud
apologetically; &ldquo;at least, all except The
Macintosh,&mdash;I couldn&rsquo;t think of her saying it
somehow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s The Macintosh?&rdquo; asked Ailie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why! was there no Macintosh in your time?&rdquo;
exclaimed Bud.&nbsp; &ldquo;I thought she went away back to
the&mdash;to the Roman period.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s the funniest old
lady in the land, and comes twice a-week to teach us dancing and
deportment.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s taught them to mostly all the
nobility and gentry of Scotland; she taught Lady Anne and all her
brothers when they were in St Andrews.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never heard of her,&rdquo; said Ailie; &ldquo;she
must be&mdash;be&mdash;be decidedly quaint.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s so quaint you&rsquo;d think she&rsquo;d be
kept in a corner cupboard with a bag of camphor at the back to
scare the moths away.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s a little wee mite, not
any bigger than me&mdash;than I,&mdash;and they say she&rsquo;s
seventy years old, but sometimes she doesn&rsquo;t look a day
more than forty-five if it weren&rsquo;t for her cap and her two
front teeth missing.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s got the loveliest fluffy
silver hair&mdash;pure white, like Mrs Molyneux&rsquo;s Aunt
Tabitha&rsquo;s Persian cat; cheeks like an apple, hands as young
as yours, and when she walks across a room she glides like this,
so you&rsquo;d think she was a cutter yacht&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bud sailed across the parlour to represent the movement of The
Macintosh with an action that made her aunties laugh, and the dog
gave one short yelp of disapproval.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was the way that Grandma Buntain walked,&mdash;it
used to be considered most genteel,&rdquo; said Bell.&nbsp;
&ldquo;They trained girls up to do it with a back-board and a
book on the top of the head; but it was out before my time; we
just walked anyway in Barbara Mushet&rsquo;s <a
name="page236"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 236</span>Seminary,
where the main things were tambouring and the
Catechism.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Macintosh is a real lady,&rdquo; Bud went
on.&nbsp; &ldquo;She&rsquo;s got genuine old ancestors.&nbsp;
They owned a Highland place called Kaims, and the lawyers have
almost lawyered it a&rsquo; awa&rsquo; she says, so now
she&rsquo;s simply got to help make a living teaching dancing and
deportment.&nbsp; I declare I don&rsquo;t know what deportment is
no more than the child unborn, unless it&rsquo;s shutting the
door behind you, walking into a room as if your head and your
legs were your own, keeping your shoulders back, and being polite
and kind to everybody, and I thought folks &rsquo;d do all that
without attending classes, unless they were looney.&nbsp; Miss
Macintosh says they are the <i>sine qua non</i> and principal
branches for a well-bred young lady in these low days of clingy
frocks and socialism; but the Principal she just smiles and gives
us another big block of English history.&nbsp; Miss Macintosh
doesn&rsquo;t let on, but I know she simply can&rsquo;t stand
English history, for she tells us, spells between quadrilles,
that there hasn&rsquo;t been any history anywhere since the Union
of the Parliaments, except the Rebellion of 1745.&nbsp; But she
doesn&rsquo;t call it a rebellion.&nbsp; She calls it &lsquo;yon
affair.&rsquo;&nbsp; <i>She&rsquo;s</i> Scotch!&nbsp; I tell you,
Auntie Bell, you&rsquo;d love to meet her!&nbsp; I sit, and sit,
and look at her like&mdash;like a cat.&nbsp; She wears
spectacles, just a little clouded, only she doesn&rsquo;t call
them spectacles; she says they are preserves, and that her eyes
are as good as anybody&rsquo;s.&nbsp; They&rsquo;re bright
enough, I tell you, for over seventy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed I would like to see the creature!&rdquo;
exclaimed Miss Bell.&nbsp; &ldquo;She must be an original!&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m sometimes just a trifle tired of the same old folk
about me here,&mdash;I know them all so well, and all
they&rsquo;re like to do or say, that there&rsquo;s nothing new
or startling to be expected from them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you like to see her?&rdquo; said Bud quickly;
&ldquo;then&mdash;then, some day I&rsquo;ll tell her, and
I&rsquo;ll bet she&rsquo;ll come.&nbsp; She dresses
queer&mdash;like a lady in the &lsquo;School <a
name="page237"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 237</span>for
Scandal,&rsquo; and wears long mittens like Miss Minto, and when
our music-master, Herr Laurent, is round she makes goo-goo eyes
at him fit to crack her glasses.&nbsp; &lsquo;Oh,
Hair-r-r!&rsquo; she says, sitting with her mitts in her
lap,&mdash;&lsquo;oh, Hair-r-r! can you no&rsquo; give the young
ladies wise-like Scotch sangs, instead o&rsquo; that dreich
Concone?&rsquo;&nbsp; And sometimes she&rsquo;ll hit him with a
fan.&nbsp; He says she plays the piano to our dancing the same as
it was a spinet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I declare it beats all!&rdquo; said Miss Bell.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Does the decent old body speak Scotch?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometimes.&nbsp; When she&rsquo;s making goo-goo eyes
at the Herr, or angry, or finding fault with us but doesn&rsquo;t
want to hurt our feelings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can understand that,&rdquo; said Miss Bell, with a
patriot&rsquo;s fervour; &ldquo;there&rsquo;s nothing like the
Scotch for any of them; I fall to it myself when I&rsquo;m
sentimental.&nbsp; And so does your Uncle Dan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She says she&rsquo;s the last of the real
Macintoshes,&mdash;that all the rest you see on Edinburgh
signboards are only incomers or poor de-degenerate cadets; and I
guess the way she says it, being a de-degenerate cadet Macintosh
must be the meanest thing under the cope and canopy.&nbsp; Heaps
of those old ancestors of hers went out in the days of the clans,
fighting for any royalty that happened along.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s
got all their hair in lockets, and makes out that when they
disappeared Scotland got a pretty hard knock.&nbsp; I said to her
once the same as Aunt Ailie says to you, Aunt Bell,
&lsquo;English and Scots, I s&rsquo;pose we&rsquo;re all
God&rsquo;s people, and it&rsquo;s a terribly open little island
to be quarrelling in, seeing all the Continent can hear us quite
plain&rsquo;; but she didn&rsquo;t like it.&nbsp; She said it was
easy seen I didn&rsquo;t understand the dear old Highland
mountains, where her great-great-grandfather, Big John of the
Axe, could collect five hundred fighting-men if he wagged a fiery
cross at them.&nbsp; &lsquo;I have Big John&rsquo;s blood in
me!&rsquo; she said, quite white, and her head shaking so much
her preserves nearly fell off her nose.&nbsp; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve
Big John&rsquo;s blood in me; and when I <a
name="page238"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 238</span>think of
things, <i>I hate the very name o&rsquo; thae aboaminable
English</i>!&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Why, you&rsquo;ve never seen
them, Miss Macintosh,&rsquo; I said&mdash;for I knew she&rsquo;d
never had a foot outside Scotland.&nbsp; &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said
she, quite sharp, &lsquo;and I don&rsquo;t want to; for they
might be nice enough, and then I wad be bound to like
them.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Bell!&rdquo; cried Ailie, laughing, &ldquo;Miss
Macintosh is surely your doppelganger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what a doppelganger is,&rdquo; said
Auntie Bell; &ldquo;but she&rsquo;s a real sensible body, and
fine I would like to see her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll have to fix it somehow,&rdquo; said
Bud, with emphasis.&nbsp; &ldquo;P&rsquo;raps you&rsquo;ll meet
her when you come to Edinburgh&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not there yet, my dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&mdash;Or she might be round this way by-and-by.&nbsp;
She&rsquo;d revel in this place; she&rsquo;d maybe not call it
quaint, but she&rsquo;d find it pretty careless about being in
the&mdash;in the modern rush she talks about, and that would make
her happier than a letter from home.&nbsp; I believe The
Macintosh&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Macintosh, my dear,&rdquo; said Bell reprovingly,
and the girl reddened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>I</i> know,&rdquo; said she.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
mean to talk of her same as she was a waterproof, and I often try
not to, because I like her immensely; but it&rsquo;s so common
among the girls that I forget.&nbsp; I believe Miss Macintosh
would love this place, and could stop in it for ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; asked Auntie Ailie
slyly.</p>
<p>Bud hesitated.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, I&mdash;I like it,&rdquo;
said she.&nbsp; &ldquo;I just love to lie awake nights and think
about it, and I can hear the wind in the trees and the tide come
in, and the bell, and the wild geese; and family worship at the
Provost&rsquo;s on Sunday nights, and I can almost <i>be</i>
here, I think so powerfully about it;
but&mdash;but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stopped short, for she saw a look of pain in the face of
her Auntie Bell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what?&rdquo; said the latter sharply.</p>
<p><a name="page239"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
239</span>&ldquo;Oh! I&rsquo;m a wicked, cruel, ungrateful girl,
Auntie Bell; and I ought to want to love this place so much,
nobody could push me out of it.&nbsp; And I <i>do</i> love it;
but I feel if I lived here always I&rsquo;d not grow any
more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re big enough,&rdquo; said Auntie Bell.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re as big as myself now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean inside.&nbsp; Am I a prig, Aunt Ailie?&nbsp;
I&rsquo;d hate to be a prig!&nbsp; But I&rsquo;d hate as bad to
tell a lie; and I feel I&rsquo;d never learn half so much or do
half so much here as I&rsquo;d do where thousands of folk were
moving along in a procession, and I was with them too.&nbsp; A
place like this is like a kindergarten&mdash;it&rsquo;s good
enough as far&rsquo;s it goes, but it doesn&rsquo;t teach the
higher branches.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bell gazed at her in wonder and pity and blame, shaking her
head.&nbsp; All this was what she had anticipated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know the feeling,&rdquo; said Aunt Ailie, &ldquo;for
I have shared it myself; and sometimes still it will come back to
me, but in my better hours I think I&rsquo;m wiser and can be
content.&nbsp; If there is growth in you, you will grow
anywhere.&nbsp; You were born in the noise of Chicago, Bud, and I
suppose it&rsquo;s hard to get it out of the ears.&nbsp;
By-and-by I hope you&rsquo;ll find that we are all of us most
truly ourselves not in the crowd but when we are alone, and that
not the smallest hamlet in the world need be intellectually
narrow for any one with imagination, some books, and a cheerful
constitution.&nbsp; Do you understand that, Bud?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bud thought hard for a moment and then shook her head.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It sounds as if it ought to be true,&rdquo; said she,
&ldquo;and I daresay you think just now it is true; but I simply
can&rsquo;t believe it.&rdquo;&nbsp; And all of them turned at
the sound of a chuckling laugh, to find that Mr Dyce had heard
this frank confession.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the worst of you, Bud,&rdquo; said
he.&nbsp; &ldquo;You will never let older folk do your thinking
for you.&rdquo;</p>

240</span>CHAPTER XXIX.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is another mercy, too, that in
our age we learn to make the best of what aforetime might be ill
to thole, as Bell made fine new garments out of old ones faded by
turning them outside in and adding frills and flounces.&nbsp;
Bud&rsquo;s absence early ceased to be deplorable, since it
wakened cheerful expectations not to be experienced had she
stayed at home; gave rise to countless fond contrivances for her
happiness in exile; and two or three times a-year to periods of
bliss, when her vacations gave the house of Dyce the very flower
of ecstasy.&nbsp; Her weekly letters of themselves were almost
compensation for her absence.&nbsp; On the days of their arrival,
Peter the post would come blithely whistling with his M.C. step
to the lawyer&rsquo;s kitchen window before he went to the castle
itself, defying all routine and the laws of the
Postmaster-General, for he knew Miss Dyce would be waiting
feverishly, having likely dreamt the night before of happy things
that&mdash;dreams going by contraries, as we all of us know in
Scotland&mdash;might portend the most dreadful tidings.</p>
<p>Bud&rsquo;s envelope was always on the top of his
budget.&nbsp; For the sake of it alone (it sometimes seemed to
Peter and those who got it) had the mail come splashing through
the night,&mdash;the lawyer&rsquo;s big blue envelopes, as it
were, had got but a friendly lift through the courtesy of clerks
in Edinburgh, and the men on the railway train, and the lad who
drove the gig from Maryfield.&nbsp; What were big blue envelopes
of the business world compared with the modest little square of
grey with Lennox Dyce&rsquo;s writing on it?</p>
<p><a name="page241"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
241</span>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the usual!&nbsp; Pretty thick
to-day!&rdquo; would Peter say, with a smack of satisfaction on
the window-sash.&nbsp; Ah, those happy Saturdays!&nbsp; Everybody
knew about them.&nbsp; &ldquo;And how&rsquo;s
hersel&rsquo;?&rdquo; the bell-ringer would ask in the by-going,
not altogether because his kindly interest led to an eye less
strict on his lazy moods in the garden.&nbsp; One Fair day, when
Maggie White&rsquo;s was irresistible, it rang so merrily with
drovers, and he lost the place again, he stopped the lawyer on
the street to ask him what Miss Lennox thought of all this
argument about the Churches, seeing she was in the thick of it in
Edinburgh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never you mind the argument, Will,&rdquo; said Daniel
Dyce,&mdash;&ldquo;you do your duty by the Auld Kirk bell; and as
for the Free folk&rsquo;s quarrelling, amang them
be&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But can you tell me, Mr D-D-Dyce,&rdquo; said Wanton
Wully, with as much assurance as if he was prepared to pay by the
Table of Fees, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the difference between the
U.F.&rsquo;s and the Frees?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve looked at it from
every point, and I canna see it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come and ask me some day when you&rsquo;re
sober,&rdquo; said the lawyer, and Wanton Wully snorted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I was sober,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I wouldna want
to ken&mdash;I wouldna give a curse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yet each time Bud came home she seemed, to the mind of her
Auntie Bell, a little farther off from them&mdash;a great deal
older, a great deal less dependent, making for womanhood in a
manner that sometimes was astounding, as when sober issues
touched her, set her thinking, made her talk in fiery
ardours.&nbsp; Aunt Ailie gloried in that rapid growth; Aunt Bell
lamented, and spoke of brains o&rsquo;ertaxed and fevered, and
studies that were dangerous.&nbsp; She made up her mind a score
of times to go herself to Edinburgh and give a warning to the
teachers; but the weeks passed, and the months, and by-and-by the
years, till almost three were gone, and the Edinburgh part of
Lennox&rsquo;s education was drawing to a close, and the warning
visit was still to pay.</p>
<p><a name="page242"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 242</span>It
was then, one Easter, came The Macintosh.</p>
<p>Bell and Ailie were out that afternoon for their daily walk in
the woods or along the shore, when Mr Dyce returned from the
Sheriff Court alert and buoyant, feeling much refreshed at the
close of an encounter with a lawyer who, he used to say, was
better at debating than himself, having more law books in his
possession and a louder voice.&nbsp; Letting himself in with his
pass-key, he entered the parlour, and was astonished to find a
stranger, who rose at his approach and revealed a figure singular
though not unpleasing.&nbsp; There was something ludicrous in her
manner as she moved a step or two from the chair in which she had
been sitting.&nbsp; Small, and silver-grey in the hair, with a
cheek that burned&mdash;it must be with
embarrassment&mdash;between a rather sallow neck and sunken
temples, and wearing smoked spectacles with rims of
tortoise-shell, she would have attracted attention anywhere even
if her dress had been less queer.&nbsp; Queer it was, but in what
manner Daniel Dyce was not the person to distinguish.&nbsp; To
him there was about it nothing definitely peculiar, except that
the woman wore a crinoline, a Paisley shawl of silken white, and
such a bonnet as he had not seen since Grandma Buntain&rsquo;s
time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be seated, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;I did
not know I had the honour of a visitor,&rdquo; and he gave a
second, keener glance, that swept the baffling figure from the
flounced green poplin to the snow-white lappet of her
bonnet.&nbsp; A lady certainly,&mdash;that was in the atmosphere,
however odd might be her dress.&nbsp; &ldquo;Where in the world
has this one dropped from?&rdquo; he asked himself, and waited an
explanation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mr Dyce!&rdquo; said the lady in a high, shrill
voice, that plainly told she never came from south of the Border,
and with a certain trepidation in her manner; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
feared I come at an inconvenient time to ye, and I maybe should
hae bided at your office; but they tell&rsquo;t me ye were out at
what they ca&rsquo;d a Pleading Diet.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve come about
my mairrage.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page243"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
243</span>&ldquo;Your marriage!&rdquo; said the lawyer, scarcely
hiding his surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, my mairrage!&rdquo; she repeated sharply, drawing
the silken shawl about her shoulders, bridling.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s naething droll, I hope and trust, in a
maiden lady ca&rsquo;in&rsquo; on a writer for his help about her
settlements!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all&mdash;not at all, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said
Daniel Dyce.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m honoured in your
confidence.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he pushed his spectacles up on his
brow that he might see her less distinctly and have the less
inclination to laugh at such an eccentric figure.</p>
<p>She broke into a torrent of explanation.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ye must
excuse me, Mr Dyce, if I&rsquo;m put-about and gey confused, for
it&rsquo;s little I&rsquo;m acquent wi&rsquo; lawyers.&nbsp;
A&rsquo; my days I&rsquo;ve heard o&rsquo; naething but their
quirks, for they maistly rookit my grandfaither.&nbsp; And I
cam&rsquo; wi&rsquo; the coach frae Maryfield, and my
heart&rsquo;s in a palpitation wi&rsquo; sic briengin&rsquo; and
bangin&rsquo; ower heughs and hills&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; She
placed a mittened hand on a much-laced stomacher, and sighed
profoundly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps&mdash;perhaps a glass of wine&mdash;&rdquo;
began the lawyer, with his eye on the bell-pull, and a notion in
his head that wine and a little seed-cake someway went with
crinolines and the age of the Paisley shawl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; she cried extravagantly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
never lip it; I&rsquo;m&mdash;I&rsquo;m in the Band o&rsquo;
Hope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lawyer started, and scanned her again through his glasses,
with a genial chuckling crow.&nbsp; &ldquo;So&rsquo;s most maiden
ladies, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad
to congratulate you on your hopes being realised.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It remains to be seen,&rdquo; said the visitor.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Gude kens what may be the upshot.&nbsp; The maist
deleeberate mairrage maun be aye a lottery, as my Auntie Grizel
o&rsquo; the Whinhill used to say; and I canna plead that
mine&rsquo;s deleeberate, for the man just took a violent fancy
the very first nicht he set his een on me, fell whummlin&rsquo;
at my feet, and wasna to be put aff wi&rsquo; <a
name="page244"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
244</span>&lsquo;No&rsquo; or &lsquo;Maybe.&rsquo;&nbsp;
We&rsquo;re a puir weak sex, Mr Dyce, and men&rsquo;s sae
domineerin&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She ogled him through her clouded glasses: her arch smile
showed a blemish of two front teeth amissing.&nbsp; He gave a nod
of sympathy, and she was off again.&nbsp; &ldquo;And to let ye
ken the outs and ins o&rsquo;t, Mr Dyce, there&rsquo;s a bit
o&rsquo; land near Perth that&rsquo;s a&rsquo; that&rsquo;s left
o&rsquo; a braw estate my forebears squandered in the
Darien.&nbsp; What I want to ken is, if I winna could hinder him
that&rsquo;s my <i>fianc&eacute;</i> frae dicin&rsquo; or
drinkin&rsquo; &rsquo;t awa&rsquo; ance he got me mairried to
him?&nbsp; I wad be sair vexed at ony such calamity, for my
family hae aye been barons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ance a baron aye a baron,&rdquo; said the lawyer,
dropping into her own broad Scots.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mr Dyce, that&rsquo;s a&rsquo; very fine; but
baron or baroness, if there&rsquo;s sic a thing, &rsquo;s no
great figure wantin&rsquo; a bit o&rsquo; grun&rsquo; to gang
wi&rsquo; the title; and John Cleghorn&mdash;that&rsquo;s my
intended&rsquo;s name&mdash;has been a gey throughither chiel in
his time by a&rsquo; reports, and I doubt wi&rsquo; men
it&rsquo;s the aulder the waur.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope in this case it&rsquo;ll be the aulder the
wiser, Miss&mdash;&rdquo; said the lawyer, and hung unheeded on
the note of interrogation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll run nae risks if I can help it,&rdquo; said
the lady emphatically; &ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll no&rsquo; put my
trust in the Edinburgh lawyers either: they&rsquo;re a&rsquo;
tarred wi&rsquo; the ae stick, or I sair misjudge them.&nbsp; But
I&rsquo;m veesitin&rsquo; a cousin owerby at Maryfield, and
I&rsquo;m tell&rsquo;t there&rsquo;s no&rsquo; a man that&rsquo;s
mair dependable in a&rsquo; the shire than yoursel&rsquo;, so I
just cam&rsquo; ower ains errand for a consultation.&nbsp; Oh,
that unco&rsquo; coach! the warld&rsquo;s gane wud, Mr Dyce,
wi&rsquo; hurry and stramash, and Scotland&rsquo;s never been the
same since&mdash;&nbsp; But there! I&rsquo;m awa&rsquo; frae my
story; if it&rsquo;s the Lord&rsquo;s will that I&rsquo;m to
marry Johnny Cleghorn, what comes o&rsquo; Kaims?&nbsp; Will he
be owner o&rsquo;t?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly not, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said Mr Dyce, with a
gravity well preserved considering his inward feelings.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Even before the Married Women&rsquo;s Property Act, <a
name="page245"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 245</span>his <i>jus
mariti</i>, as we ca&rsquo; it, gave him only his wife&rsquo;s
personal and moveable estate.&nbsp; There is no such thing as
<i>communio bonorum</i>&mdash;as community of goods&mdash;between
husband and wife in Scotland.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he canna sell Kaims on me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; it&rsquo;s yours and your assigns <i>ad perpetuam
remanentiam</i>, being feudal right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish ye wad speak in honest English, like
mysel&rsquo;, Mr Dyce,&rdquo; said the lady sharply.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve forgotten a&rsquo; my Laiten, and the very
sound o&rsquo;t gars my heid bizz.&nbsp; I doubt it&rsquo;s the
lawyer&rsquo;s way o&rsquo; gettin&rsquo; round puir helpless
bodies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s scarcely that,&rdquo; said Mr Dyce,
laughing.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the only chance we get to air
auld Mr Trayner, and it&rsquo;s thought to be
imposin&rsquo;.&nbsp; <i>Ad perpetuam remanentiam</i> just means
to remain for ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thocht that maybe John might hae the poo&rsquo;er to
treat Kaims as my tocher.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even if he had,&rdquo; said Mr Dyce, &ldquo;a
<i>dot</i>, or <i>dos</i>, or tocher, in the honest law of
Scotland, was never the price o&rsquo; the husband&rsquo;s hand;
he could only use the fruits o&rsquo;t.&nbsp; He is not entitled
to dispose of it, and must restore it intact if unhappily the
marriage should at any time be dissolved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dissolved!&rdquo; cried the lady.&nbsp; &ldquo;Fegs!
ye&rsquo;re in an awfu&rsquo; hurry, and the ring no&rsquo;
bought yet.&nbsp; Supposin&rsquo; I was deein&rsquo;
first?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In that case I presume that you would have the
succession settled on your husband.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On Johnny Cleghorn!&nbsp; Catch me!&nbsp; There&rsquo;s
sic a thing as&mdash;as&mdash;as bairns, Mr Dyce,&rdquo; and the
lady simpered coyly, while the lawyer rose hurriedly to fumble
with some books and hide his confusion at such a wild
conjecture.&nbsp; He was relieved by the entrance of Bell and
Ailie, who stood amazed at the sight of the odd and unexpected
visitor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My sisters,&rdquo; said the lawyer hastily.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Miss&mdash;Miss&mdash;I did not catch the name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Macintosh,&rdquo; said the stranger nervously, and
Bell cried out immediately, &ldquo;I was perfectly <a
name="page246"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 246</span>assured of
it!&nbsp; Lennox has often spoken of you, and I&rsquo;m so glad
to see you.&nbsp; I did not know you were in the
neighbourhood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ailie was delighted with so picturesque a figure.&nbsp; She
could scarcely keep her eyes off the many-flounced, expansive
gown of poplin, the stomacher, the ponderous ear-rings, the great
cameo brooch, the long lace mittens, the Paisley shawl, the neat
poke-bonnet, and the fresh old face marred only by the
spectacles, and the gap where the teeth were missing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have just been consultin&rsquo; Mr Dyce on my
comin&rsquo; mairrage,&rdquo; said The Macintosh; and at this
intelligence from a piece of such antiquity Miss Bell&rsquo;s
face betrayed so much astonishment that Dan and Ailie almost
forgot their good manners.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! if it&rsquo;s business&mdash;&rdquo; said Bell, and
rose to go; but The Macintosh put a hand on her sleeve and stayed
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye needna fash to leave, Miss Dyce,&rdquo; said
she.&nbsp; &ldquo;A&rsquo;thing&rsquo;s settled.&nbsp; It seems
that Johnny Cleghorn canna ca&rsquo; a rig o&rsquo; Kaims his ain
when he mairries me, and that was a&rsquo; I cam&rsquo; to see
about.&nbsp; Oh, it&rsquo;s a mischancy thing a mairrage, Miss
Dyce; maist folk gang intill&rsquo;t heels-ower-hurdies, but
I&rsquo;m in an awfu&rsquo; swither, and havena a mither to guide
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep me!&rdquo; said Miss Bell, out of all patience at
such maidenly apprehensions, &ldquo;ye&rsquo;re surely auld
enough to ken your ain mind.&nbsp; I hope the guidman&rsquo;s
worthy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s no&rsquo; that ill&mdash;as men-folk
gang,&rdquo; said The Macintosh resignedly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s as fat&rsquo;s creish, and has a
craighlin&rsquo; cough, the body, and he&rsquo;s faur frae bonny,
and he hasna a bawbee o&rsquo; his ain, and sirs! what a
reputation!&nbsp; But a man&rsquo;s a man, Miss Dyce, and
time&rsquo;s aye fleein&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At such a list of disabilities in a husband the Dyces lost all
sense of the proprieties and broke into laughter, in which the
lady joined them, shaking in her arm-chair.&nbsp; Bell was the
first to recover with a guilty sense that this was very bad for
Daniel&rsquo;s <a name="page247"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
247</span>business.&nbsp; She straightened her face and was about
to make apologies, when Footles bounded in at the open door, to
throw himself at the feet of The Macintosh and wave a joyous
tail.&nbsp; But he was not content there.&nbsp; In spite of her
resistance, he must be in her lap, and then, for the first time,
Bell and Ailie noticed a familiar cadence in the stranger&rsquo;s
laugh.</p>
<p>Dan rose and clapped her on the back.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well done,
Bud!&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ye had us a&rsquo;; but Footles
wasna to be swindled wi&rsquo; an auld wife&rsquo;s goon,&rdquo;
and he gently drew the spectacles from the laughing eyes of his
naughty niece!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you rogue!&rdquo; cried Auntie Ailie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wretch!&rdquo; cried Auntie Bell.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
might have known your cantrips.&nbsp; Where in the world did you
get these clothes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bud sailed across the room like a cutter yacht and put her
arms about her neck.&nbsp; &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you know
me?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How could I know you, dressed up like that?&nbsp; And
your teeth&mdash;you imp! they&rsquo;re blackened; and your
neck&mdash;you jad! it&rsquo;s painted; and&mdash;oh, lassie,
lassie!&nbsp; Awa&rsquo;! awa&rsquo;! the deil&rsquo;s ower grit
wi&rsquo; ye!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t <i>you</i> know me, Aunt Ailie?&rdquo;
asked Bud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not in the least,&rdquo; said Ailie, taking the droll
old figure in her arms.&nbsp; &ldquo;Perhaps I might have known
you if I didn&rsquo;t think it was to-morrow you were
coming.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was to have been to-morrow; but the measles have
broken out in school, and I came a day earlier, and calculated
I&rsquo;d just hop in and surprise you all.&nbsp; Didn&rsquo;t
you guess, Uncle Dan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at first,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
admit I was fairly deceived, but when you talked about being in
the Band of Hope I saw at a shot through The Macintosh.&nbsp; I
hope you liked my Latin, Bud.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page248"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
248</span>CHAPTER XXX.</h2>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">You</span> surely did not come in
these daft-like garments all the way from Edinburgh?&rdquo; asked
her Auntie Bell, when the wig had been removed and Bud&rsquo;s
youth was otherwise resumed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all!&rdquo; said Bud, sparkling with the success
of her deception.&nbsp; &ldquo;I came almost enough of a finished
young lady to do you credit, but when I found there was nobody in
the house except Kate, I felt I couldn&rsquo;t get a better
chance to introduce you to The Macintosh if I waited for a
year.&nbsp; I told you we&rsquo;d been playing charades last
winter at the school, and I got Jim to send me some make-up, the
wig, and this real &rsquo;cute old lady&rsquo;s dress.&nbsp; They
were all in my box to give you some fun sometime, and Kate helped
me hook things, though she was mighty scared to think how angry
you might be, Aunt Bell; and when I was ready for you she said
she&rsquo;d be sure to laugh fit to burst, and then you&rsquo;d
see it was only me dressed up, and Footles he barked, so he
looked like giving the show away, so I sent them both out into
the garden and sat in a stage-fright that almost shook my
ear-rings off.&nbsp; I tell you I felt mighty poorly sitting
there wondering what on earth I was to say; but by-and-by I got
to be so much The Macintosh I felt almost sure enough her to have
the rheumatism, and knew I could fix up gags to keep the part
going.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t expect Uncle Dan would be the first
to come in, or I wouldn&rsquo;t have felt so brave about it,
he&rsquo;s so sharp and suspicious&mdash;that&rsquo;s with being
a lawyer, I s&rsquo;pose, they&rsquo;re a&rsquo; tarred wi&rsquo;
the <a name="page249"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 249</span>ae
stick, Miss Macintosh says; and when he talked all that solemn
Latin stuff and looked like running up a bill for law advice that
would ruin me, I laughed inside enough to ache.&nbsp; Now
<i>amn&rsquo;t</i> I just the very wickedest girl, Uncle
Dan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A little less Scotch and a more plausible story would
have made the character perfect,&rdquo; said her uncle.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Where did you get them both?&nbsp; Miss Macintosh was
surely not the only model?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, she&rsquo;s not so Scotch as I made out, except
when she&rsquo;s very sentimental, but I felt she&rsquo;d have to
be as Scotch as the mountain and the flood to fit these clothes;
and she&rsquo;s never talked about marrying anybody herself, but
she&rsquo;s making a match just now for a cousin of hers, and
tells us all about it.&nbsp; I was partly her, but not enough to
be unkind or mean, and partly her cousin, and a little bit of the
Waverley Novels,&mdash;in fact, I was pure mosaic, like our
dog.&nbsp; There wasn&rsquo;t enough real quaint about Miss
Macintosh for ordinary to make a front scene monologue go, but
she&rsquo;s fuller of hints than&mdash;than a dictionary, and
once I started I felt I could play half a dozen Macintoshes all
different, so&rsquo;s you&rsquo;d actually think she was a
surging crowd.&nbsp; You see there&rsquo;s the Jacobite
Macintosh, and the &lsquo;aboaminable&rsquo; English Macintosh,
and the flirting Macintosh who raps Herr Laurent with her fan,
and the fortune-telling Macintosh who reads palms and tea-cup
leaves, and the dancing and deportment Macintosh who knows all
the first families in Scotland.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bud solemnly counted off the various Macintoshes on her
finger-tips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have every one of them when you come home
next winter,&rdquo; said Miss Ailie.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
prefer it to the opera.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t deny but it&rsquo;s diverting,&rdquo;
said Miss Bell; &ldquo;still, it&rsquo;s dreadfully like
play-acting, and hardly the thing for a sober dwelling.&nbsp;
Lassie, lassie, away this instant and change yourself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>If prizes and Italian songs had really been the <a
name="page250"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 250</span>proof that
Bud had taken on the polish, she would have disappointed Uncle
Dan, but this art of hers was enough to make full amends, it gave
so much diversion.&nbsp; Character roused and held her interest;
she had a lightning eye for oddities of speech and gesture.&nbsp;
Most of a man&rsquo;s philosophy is in a favourite phrase, his
individuality is betrayed in the way he carries his hat along the
aisle on Sunday.&nbsp; Bud, each time that she came home from
Edinburgh, collected phrases as others do postage-stamps, and
knew how every hat in town was carried.&nbsp; Folk void of
idiosyncrasy, having the natural self restrained by watchfulness
and fear, were the only ones whose company she wearied of; all
others she studied with delight, storing of each some simulacrum
in her memory.&nbsp; Had she reproduced them in a way to make
them look ridiculous she would have roused the Dyces&rsquo;
disapproval, but lacking any sense of superiority she made no
impersonation look ignoble; the portraits in her gallery, like
Raeburn&rsquo;s, borrowed a becoming curl or two and toned down
crimson noses.</p>
<p>But her favourite character was The Macintosh in one of the
countless phases that at last were all her own invention, and far
removed from the original.&nbsp; Each time she came home, the
dancing-mistress they had never really seen became a more
familiar personage to the Dyces.&nbsp; &ldquo;I declare,&rdquo;
cried Bell, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m beginning to think of you always as
a droll old body.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;And how&rsquo;s the
rheumatism?&rdquo; Dan would ask; it was &ldquo;The Macintosh
said this&rdquo; or &ldquo;The Macintosh said that&rdquo; with
Ailie; and even Kate would quote the dancing-mistress with such
earnestness, that the town became familiar with the name and
character without suspecting they were often merely parts assumed
by young Miss Lennox.</p>
<p>Bud carried the joke one night to daring lengths by going as
Miss Macintosh with Ailie to a dance, in a gown and pelerine of
Grandma Buntain&rsquo;s that had made tremendous conquests eighty
years before.</p>
<p>Our dances at the inn are not like city routs: <a
name="page251"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 251</span>Petronella,
La Temp&ecirc;te, and the reel have still an honoured place in
them; we think the joy of life is not meant wholly for the young
and silly, and so the elderly attend them.&nbsp; We sip
claret-cup and tea in the alcove or &ldquo;adjacent,&rdquo; and
gossip together if our dancing days are done, or sit below the
flags and heather, humming &ldquo;Merrily danced the
quaker&rsquo;s wife,&rdquo; with an approving eye on our bonny
daughters.&nbsp; Custom gives the Provost and his lady a place of
honour in the alcove behind the music: here is a petty court
where the civic spirit pays its devoirs, where the lockets are
large and strong, and hair-chains much abound, and mouths before
the mellowing midnight hour are apt to be a little mim.</p>
<p>Towards the alcove, Ailie&mdash;Dan discreetly moving
elsewhere&mdash;boldly led The Macintosh, whose ballooning silk
brocade put even the haughtiest of the other dames in
shadow.&nbsp; She swam across the floor as if her hoops and not
her buckled shoon sustained her, as if she moved on air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dod! here&rsquo;s a character!&rdquo; said Dr Brash,
pulling down his waistcoat.&nbsp; &ldquo;Where have the Dyces
gotten her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Ark is landed,&rdquo; said the Provost&rsquo;s
lady.&nbsp; &ldquo;What a peculiar creature!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ailie gravely gave the necessary introductions, and soon the
notable Miss Macintosh of Kaims was the lion of the
assembly.&nbsp; She flirted most outrageously with the older
beaux, sharing roguish smiles and taps of the fan between them,
and, compelling unaccustomed gallantries, set their wives all
laughing.&nbsp; They drank wine with her in the old style; she
met them glass for glass in water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll gie ye a toast now,&rdquo; she said,
when her turn came&mdash;&ldquo;Scotland&rsquo;s Rights,&rdquo;
raising her glass of water with a dramatic gesture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dod! the auld body&rsquo;s got an arm on her,&rdquo;
whispered Dr Brash to Colin Cleland, seeing revealed the pink
plump flesh between the short sleeves and the top of the
mittens.</p>
<p><a name="page252"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 252</span>They
drank the sentiment&mdash;the excuse for the glass was good
enough, though in these prosaic days a bit mysterious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are they?&rdquo; asked the Provost.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are what?&rdquo; said The Macintosh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Scotland&rsquo;s Rights.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll leave it to my frien&rsquo; Mr Dyce to tell
ye,&rdquo; she said quickly, for the lawyer had now joined the
group.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;ll aiblins cost ye 6s. 8d., but for
that I daresay he can gie ye them in the Laiten.&nbsp;
But&mdash;but I hope we&rsquo;re a&rsquo; friens here?&rdquo; she
exclaimed with a hurried glance round her company.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
hope we have nane o&rsquo; thae aboaminable English amang
us.&nbsp; I canna thole them!&nbsp; It has been a sair dooncome
for Scotland since ever she drew in wi&rsquo; them.&rdquo;&nbsp;
For a space she dwelt on themes of rather antique patriotism that
made her audience smile, for in truth in this burgh town we see
no difference between Scotch and English: in our calculations
there are only the lucky folk, born, bred, and dwelling within
the sound of Will Oliver&rsquo;s bell, and the poor souls who
have to live elsewhere, all equally unfortunate, whether they be
English, Irish, or Scots.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But here I&rsquo;m keepin&rsquo; you gentlemen frae
your dancin&rsquo;,&rdquo; she said, interrupting herself, and
consternation fell on her company, for sets were being formed for
a quadrille, and her innuendo was unmistakable.&nbsp; She looked
from one to the other of them as if enjoying their
discomfiture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;I haven&rsquo;t danced, myself, for
years,&rdquo; said the Provost, which was true; and Colin
Cleland, sighing deeply in his prominent profile and hiding his
feet, protested quadrilles were beyond him.&nbsp; The younger men
quickly remembered other engagements and disappeared.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Will you do me the honour?&rdquo; said Dr Brash&mdash;good
man! a gentle hero&rsquo;s heart was under that wrinkled
waistcoat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said The Macintosh, rising to his arm,
&ldquo;you&rsquo;ll be sure and no&rsquo; to swing me aff my
feet, for I&rsquo;m but a frail and giddy creature.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page253"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
253</span>&ldquo;It would be but paying you back,&rdquo; said the
Doctor, bowing.&nbsp; &ldquo;Miss Macintosh has been swinging us
a&rsquo; aff our feet since she entered the room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She laughed behind her clouded glasses, tapped him lightly
with her fan, and swam into the opening movement of the
figure.&nbsp; The word&rsquo;s abused, yet I can but say she
danced divinely, with such grace, lightness of foot, and rhythm
of the body that folk stared at her in admiration and
incredulity: her carriage, seen from behind, came perilously near
betraying her, and possibly her partner might have soon
discovered who he had, even if she had not made him a
confession.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Upon my word!&rdquo; said he, in a pause between the
figures,&mdash;&ldquo;Upon my word! you dance magnificently, Miss
Macintosh.&nbsp; I must apologise for such a stiff old partner as
you&rsquo;ve gotten.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I micht weel dance,&rdquo; said she.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
ken I&rsquo;m a dancin&rsquo;-mistress?&rdquo;&nbsp; Then she
whispered hurriedly in her natural voice to him.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
feel real bold, Dr Brash, to be dancing with you here when I
haven&rsquo;t come out yet, and I feel real mean to be deceiving
you, who would dance with an old frump just because you&rsquo;re
sorry for her, and I <i>can&rsquo;t</i> do it one minute
longer.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you know me, really?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good Lord!&rdquo; said he in an undertone,
aghast.&nbsp; &ldquo;Miss Lennox!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only for you,&rdquo; she whispered.&nbsp; &ldquo;Please
don&rsquo;t tell anybody else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You beat all,&rdquo; he told her.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
suppose I&rsquo;m making myself ridiculous dancing away here
with&mdash;h&rsquo;m!&mdash;auld langsyne, but faith I have the
advantage now of the others, and you mustn&rsquo;t let on when
the thing comes out that I did not know you from the
outset.&nbsp; I have a crow to pick with Miss Ailie about
this&mdash;the rogue!&nbsp; But, young woman, it&rsquo;s an
actress you are!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet, but it&rsquo;s an actress I mean to be,&rdquo;
she said, pousetting with him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m!&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;there seems the
natural gift for <a name="page254"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
254</span>it, but once on a time I made up my mind it was to be
poetry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got over poetry,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I found I was only one of that kind of poets who always
cut it up in fourteen-line lengths and begin with &lsquo;As
when.&rsquo;&nbsp; No, it&rsquo;s to be the stage, Dr Brash; I
guess God&rsquo;s fixed it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whiles He is&mdash;h&rsquo;m&mdash;injudicious,&rdquo;
said the Doctor.&nbsp; &ldquo;But what about Aunt
Bell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no buts about it, though I admit
I&rsquo;m worried to think of Auntie Bell.&nbsp; She considers
acting is almost as bad as lying, and talks about the theatre as
Satan&rsquo;s abode.&nbsp; If it wasn&rsquo;t that she was from
home to-night, I daren&rsquo;t have been here.&nbsp; I
wish&mdash;I wish I didn&rsquo;t love her
so&mdash;almost&mdash;for I feel I&rsquo;ve got to vex her pretty
bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed you have!&rdquo; said Dr Brash.&nbsp; &ldquo;And
you&rsquo;ve spoiled my dancing, for I&rsquo;ve a great respect
for that devoted little woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Back in the alcove The Macintosh found more to surround her
than ever, though it was the penalty of her apparent age that
they were readier to joke than dance with her.&nbsp; Captain
Consequence, wanting a wife with money, if and when his mother
should be taken from him, never lost a chance to see how a
pompous manner and his medals would affect strange ladies.&nbsp;
He was so marked in his attention, and created such amusement to
the company, that, pitying him, and fearful of her own deception,
she proposed to tell fortunes.&nbsp; The ladies brought her their
emptied teacups; the men solemnly laid their palms before her;
she divined, for all, their past and future in a practised way
that astonished her uncle and aunt, who, afraid of some awkward
sally, had kept aloof at first from her levee, but now were the
most interested of her audience.</p>
<p>Over the leaves in Miss Minto&rsquo;s cup she frowned through
her clouded glasses.&nbsp; &ldquo;There&rsquo;s lots o&rsquo;
money,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;and a braw house, and a muckle
garden wi&rsquo; bees and trees in&rsquo;t, and a wheen boys
speilin&rsquo; <a name="page255"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
255</span>the wa&rsquo;s&mdash;you may be aye assured o&rsquo;
bien circumstances, Miss Minto.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Minto, warmly conscious of the lawyer at her back, could
have wished for a fortune less prosaic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look again; is there no&rsquo; a man to keep the
laddies awa&rsquo;?&rdquo; suggested the Provost, pawky body!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I declare there is!&rdquo; cried The Macintosh, taking
the hint.&nbsp; &ldquo;See; there! he&rsquo;s under this tree,
a&rsquo; huddled up in an awfu&rsquo; passion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t make out his head,&rdquo; said the
Provost&rsquo;s lady.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some men hae nane,&rdquo; retorted the spaewife;
&ldquo;but what&rsquo;s to hinder ye imaginin&rsquo; it like
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! if it&rsquo;s imagination,&rdquo; said the
Provost&rsquo;s lady, &ldquo;I can hear him swearin&rsquo;.&nbsp;
And now, what&rsquo;s my cup?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see here,&rdquo; said The Macintosh, &ldquo;a kind
o&rsquo; island far at sea, and a ship sailin&rsquo; frae&rsquo;t
this way, wi&rsquo; flags to the mast-heid, and a man on
board.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope he&rsquo;s well, then,&rdquo; said the
Provost&rsquo;s lady, &ldquo;for that&rsquo;s our James, and
he&rsquo;s coming from Barbadoes: we had a letter just last
week.&nbsp; Indeed you&rsquo;re a perfect wizard!&rdquo;&nbsp;
She had forgotten that her darling James&rsquo;s coming was the
talk of the town for ten days back.</p>
<p>Colin Cleland, rubicund, good-natured, with his shyness gone,
next proffered his palm to read.&nbsp; His hand lay like a
plaice, inelegant and large, in hers, whose fresh young beauty
might have roused suspicion in observers less carried away in the
general illusion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! sir,&rdquo; said she with a sigh, &ldquo;ye hae had
your trials!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mony a ane, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said the jovial
Colin.&nbsp; &ldquo;I was ance a lawyer, for my sins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s no&rsquo; the kind o&rsquo; trial I
mean,&rdquo; said The Macintosh.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a
wheen o&rsquo; auld tribulations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you&rsquo;re richt, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; he
admitted.&nbsp; &ldquo;I hae a sorry lot o&rsquo; them marked
doon in auld diaries, but gude-be-thanked I canna mind them
unless I look <a name="page256"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
256</span>them up.&nbsp; They werena near sae mony as the
rattlin&rsquo; ploys I&rsquo;ve had.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there no&rsquo; a wife for Mr Cleland?&rdquo; said
the Provost&mdash;pawky, pawky man!</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was ance, I see, a girl, and she was the richt
girl too,&rdquo; said The Macintosh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but I was the wrang man,&rdquo; said Colin
Cleland, drawing his hand away, and nobody laughed, for all but
The Macintosh knew that story and made it some excuse for foolish
habits.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a bit of a warlock myself,&rdquo; said Dr
Brash, beholding the spaewife&rsquo;s vexation at a
<i>faux-pas</i> she only guessed herself guilty of.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll read your loof, Miss Macintosh, if ye let
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They all insisted she should submit herself to the
Doctor&rsquo;s unusual art, and taking her hand in his he drew
the mitten off and pretended to scan the lines.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Travel&mdash;h&rsquo;m&mdash;a serious
illness&mdash;h&rsquo;m&mdash;your life, in youth, was quite
adventurous, Miss Macintosh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I&rsquo;m no&rsquo; that auld yet,&rdquo; she
corrected him.&nbsp; &ldquo;There&rsquo;s mony a chance at
fifty.&nbsp; Never mind my past, Dr Brash, what about my
future?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He glanced up a moment and saw her aunt and uncle listening in
amusement, unaware as yet that he knew the secret, then scanned
her palm again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The future&mdash;h&rsquo;m! let me see.&nbsp; A long
line of life; heart line healthy&mdash;h&rsquo;m&mdash;the best
of your life&rsquo;s before you, though I cannot say it may be
the happiest part of it.&nbsp; Perhaps
my&mdash;h&rsquo;m&mdash;my skill a little fails here.&nbsp; You
have a strong will, Miss&mdash;Miss Macintosh, and I doubt in
this world you&rsquo;ll aye have your own way.&nbsp;
And&mdash;h&rsquo;m&mdash;an odd destiny surely &rsquo;s before
you&mdash;I see the line of Fame, won&mdash;h&rsquo;m&mdash;in a
multitude of characters; by the Lord Hairry, ma&rsquo;am,
you&rsquo;re to be&mdash;you&rsquo;re to be an
actress!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The company laughed at such a prophecy for one so antiquated,
and the Doctor&rsquo;s absurdity put an end to the spaeing of
fortunes, but he had effected his <a name="page257"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 257</span>purpose.&nbsp; He had found the
words that expressed the hope, half-entertained, so far, of
Ailie, and the fear of her brother Dan.&nbsp; They learned before
they left that he had not spoken without his cue, yet it was a
little saddened they went home at midnight with their ward in
masquerade.</p>
<h2><a name="page258"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
258</span>CHAPTER XXXI.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Fortunately</span> Kate&rsquo;s marriage
came to distract them for a while from the thought of Bud&rsquo;s
future.&nbsp; The essential house had been found that was
suitable for a captain, yet not too dearly rented,&mdash;a piece
of luck in a community where dwellings are rarely vacant, and
every tenant over eighty years of age has the uneasy
consciousness that half a dozen pairs betrothed have already
decided upon a different colour of paint for his windows, and
have become resigned, with a not unpleasing melancholy, to the
thought that in the course of nature his time cannot be long.</p>
<p>The Captain&mdash;that once roving eagle-heart subdued by love
for the maid of Colonsay&mdash;so persistently discouraged any
yachting trips which took the <i>Wave</i> for more than a night
or two from her moorings, that Lady Anne and her husband, knowing
the heart themselves, recommended immediate marriage; and Miss
Bell, in consequence, was scouring the countryside for
Kate&rsquo;s successor in the kitchen, but hopeless of coming on
one who could cook good kail, have a cheery face, and be a strict
communicant.&nbsp; &ldquo;I can get fine cooks that are wanting
in the grace of God, and pious girls who couldn&rsquo;t be
trusted to bake a Christian scone,&rdquo; she said;
&ldquo;it&rsquo;s a choice between two evils.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of two evils choose the third, then,&rdquo; said Dan to
his sister, flushed and exhilarated by a search that, for elderly
maiden ladies, makes up for an older hunt.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
sport&rsquo;s agreeing with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a great distress to Bud that the wedding should take
place in the house and not in church, as <a
name="page259"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 259</span>seemed most
fitting.&nbsp; She felt a private ceremony deprived her of a
spectacle, with Miss Amelia Duff playing the wedding march on the
harmonium, and the audience filing up the aisle in their Sunday
clothes, the carriage of their hats revealing character.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you&rsquo;re simply going to make it look like a
plain tea!&rdquo; she protested.&nbsp; &ldquo;If it was my
marriage, Kate, I&rsquo;d have it as solemn and grand as Harvest
Sunday.&nbsp; A body doesn&rsquo;t get married to a man in brass
buttons every other day, and it&rsquo;s a chance for
style.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We never have our weddings in the church,&rdquo; said
Kate.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sometimes the gentry do, but it&rsquo;s not
considered nice; it&rsquo;s kind of Roman Catholic.&nbsp; Forbye,
in a church, where would you get the fun?&rdquo;</p>
<p>If Bud hadn&rsquo;t realised that fun was the main thing at
Scottish weddings, she got hints of it in Kate&rsquo;s
preparation.&nbsp; Croodles and hysterics took possession of the
bride: she was sure she would never get through the ceremony with
her life, or she would certainly do something silly that would
make the whole world laugh at her and dreadfully vex the
Captain.&nbsp; Even her wedding-dress, whose prospect had filled
her dreams with gladness, but deepened her depression when it
came from the manteau-makers: she wept sad stains on the front
width, and the orange-blossom they rehearsed with might have been
a wreath of the bitter rue.&nbsp; Bud wanted her to try the dress
on, but the bride was aghast at such an unlucky proposition; so
she tried it on herself, with sweet results, if one did not look
at the gathers in the back.&nbsp; They practised the ceremony the
night before, Kate&rsquo;s sister from Colonsay (who was to be
her bridesmaid) playing the part of a tall, brass-buttoned
bridegroom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Kate!&rdquo; cried Bud pitifully, &ldquo;you stand
there like&rsquo;s you were a soda-water bottle and the cork
lost.&nbsp; My goodness! brisk up a bit.&nbsp; If it&rsquo;s hard
on you, just remember it isn&rsquo;t much of a joke for
Charles.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you know the eyes a the public are on
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page260"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
260</span>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just it,&rdquo; said poor
Kate.&nbsp; &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t be frightened a bit if it
wasn&rsquo;t for that, for I&rsquo;m so brave.&nbsp; What do you
do with your hands?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You just keep hold of them.&nbsp; Mercy! don&rsquo;t
let them hang like that,&mdash;they&rsquo;re yours; up till now
he&rsquo;s got nothing to do with them.&nbsp; Now for the
tears&mdash;where&rsquo;s your handkerchief?&nbsp; That
one&rsquo;s yards too big, and there isn&rsquo;t an edge of lace
to peek through, but it&rsquo;ll do this time.&nbsp; It&rsquo;ll
all be right on the night.&nbsp; Now the minister&rsquo;s
speaking, and you&rsquo;re looking down at the carpet and
you&rsquo;re timid and fluttered and nervous and thinking what an
epoch this is in your sinful life, and how you won&rsquo;t be
Kate MacNeill any more but Mrs Charles Maclean, and the Lord
knows if you will be happy with him&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bride blubbered and threw her apron over her head as
usual: Bud was in despair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you are a silly!&rdquo; she exclaimed.&nbsp;
&ldquo;All you want is a gentle tear or two trickling down the
side of your nose, enough to make your eyes blink but not enough
to soak your veil or leave streaks.&nbsp; And there you gush like
a waterspout, and damp your face so much the bridegroom&rsquo;ll
catch his death of cold when he kisses you!&nbsp; Stop it, Kate
MacNeill,&mdash;it isn&rsquo;t anybody&rsquo;s funeral: why,
weddings aren&rsquo;t so very fatal; lots of folk get over
them&mdash;leastways in America.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help it!&rdquo; protested the weeping
maid.&nbsp; &ldquo;I never could be melancholy in moderation, and
the way you speak you make me think it&rsquo;s running a dreadful
risk to marry anybody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Bud, &ldquo;you needn&rsquo;t think
of things so harrowing, I suppose.&nbsp; Just squeeze your eyes
together and bite your lip, and perhaps it&rsquo;ll start a tear:
if it don&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;ll look like as if you were bravely
struggling with emotion.&nbsp; And then there&rsquo;s the proud
glad smile as you back out on Charles&rsquo;s arm&mdash;give her
your arm, Minnie,&mdash;the trial&rsquo;s over, you know, and
you&rsquo;ve got on a lovely new plain ring, and all the other
girls are envious, and Charles Maclean and you are one <a
name="page261"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 261</span>till death
do you part.&nbsp; Oh, Kate, Kate! don&rsquo;t grin; that&rsquo;s
not a smile, it&rsquo;s a&mdash;it&rsquo;s a railroad
track.&nbsp; Look&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; Bud assumed a smile that
spoke of gladness and humility, confidence and a maiden&rsquo;s
fears,&mdash;a smile that appealed and charmed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t smile like that to save my
life,&rdquo; said Kate in a despair.&nbsp; &ldquo;I wish you had
learned me that instead of the height of Popacatthekettle.&nbsp;
Do you think he&rsquo;ll be angry if I don&rsquo;t do them things
properly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who? Charles!&nbsp; Why, Charles&rsquo;ll be so
mortally scared himself he wouldn&rsquo;t notice if you made
faces at him, or were a different girl altogether.&nbsp;
He&rsquo;ll have a dull dead booming in his ears, and wonder
whether it&rsquo;s wedding-day or apple-custard: all of them
I&rsquo;ve seen married looked like that.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not
for Charles you should weep and smile; it&rsquo;s for the front
of the house, you know,&mdash;it&rsquo;s for the people looking
on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Toots!&rdquo; said Kate, relieved.&nbsp; &ldquo;If
it&rsquo;s only for them, I needn&rsquo;t bother.&nbsp; I thought
that maybe it was something truly refined that he would be
expecting.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not&mdash;it&rsquo;s not the front of
a house I&rsquo;m marrying.&nbsp; Tell me this and tell me no
more&mdash;is there anything special I should do to please my
Charles?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d worry,&rdquo; said Bud on
reflection.&nbsp; &ldquo;I daresay it&rsquo;s better not to think
of anything dramatic.&nbsp; If I were you I&rsquo;d just keep
calm as grass, and pray the Lord to give me a good contented mind
and hurry up the clergyman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But yet was the maiden full of a consciousness of
imperfection, since she had seen that day the bride&rsquo;s-cake
on view in the baker&rsquo;s window,&mdash;an edifice of art so
splendid that she felt she could never be worthy of it.&nbsp;
&ldquo;How do you think I&rsquo;ll look?&rdquo; she asked.&nbsp;
And Bud assured her she would look magnificently lovely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I wish I did,&rdquo; she sighed.&nbsp; &ldquo;But
I&rsquo;m feared I&rsquo;ll not look so lovely as I think I
do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No girl ever did,&rdquo; said Bud.&nbsp;
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s impossible; <a name="page262"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 262</span>but when Charles comes to and sits
up he&rsquo;ll think you&rsquo;re It: he&rsquo;ll think you
perfect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed I&rsquo;m far from that,&rdquo; said Kate.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I have just my health and napery and a liking for the
chap, and I wish I wasn&rsquo;t near so red.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bud was able to instruct her in the right deportment for a
bride, but had no experience in the management of husbands: for
that Kate had to take some hints from her mistress, who was under
the delusion that her brother Dan was the standard of his
sex.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re curious creatures,&rdquo; Bell
confided.&nbsp; &ldquo;You must have patience, ay, and humour
them.&nbsp; They&rsquo;ll trot at your heels like pussy for a
cheese-pudding, but they&rsquo;ll not be driven.&nbsp; If I had a
man I would never thwart him.&nbsp; If he was out of temper or
unreasonable I would tell him he was looking ill, and that would
make him feared and humble.&nbsp; When a man thinks he&rsquo;s
ill, his trust must be in the Lord and in his woman-kind.&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s where we have the upper hand of them!&nbsp; First
and last, the thing&rsquo;s to be agreeable.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll
find he&rsquo;ll never put anything in its proper place, and
that&rsquo;s a heartbreak, but it&rsquo;s not so bad as if he
broke the dishes and blackened your eyes, the way they do in the
newspapers.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s one thing that&rsquo;s the secret
of a happy home&mdash;to live in the fear of God and within your
income, faith! you can&rsquo;t live very well without
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, mem! it&rsquo;s a desperate thing a wedding,&rdquo;
said the maid.&nbsp; &ldquo;I never, in all my life, had so much
to think about before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There were stricken lads in these days!&nbsp; The more
imminent became her utter loss, the more desirable Kate
became.&nbsp; But sentiment in country towns is an accommodating
thing, and all the old suitors&mdash;the whistlers in the close
and purveyors of conversation lozenges&mdash;found consolation in
the fun at the wedding, and danced their griefs away on the flags
of the Dyces&rsquo; kitchen.</p>
<p>A noble wedding!&nbsp; All the cookery skill of Kate and her
mistress was expended on it, and discretion, <a
name="page263"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 263</span>for the
sake of the incredulous, forbids enumeration of the roasted
hens.&nbsp; Chanticleers in the town crowed roupily and ruefully
for months thereafter.&nbsp; The bridegroom might have stepped
over the wall to the wedding chamber, or walked to it in a
hundred paces up the lane: he rode instead in a carriage that
made a stately and circuitous approach round John Turner&rsquo;s
Corner, and wished the distance had been twenty times as
long.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that I&rsquo;m feared,&rdquo;
said he, &ldquo;or that I&rsquo;ve rued the gyurl, but&mdash;but
it&rsquo;s kind of sudden!&rdquo;&mdash;a curious estimate of a
courtship that had started in the burial-ground of Colonsay so
many years before!</p>
<p>A noble wedding&mdash;its revelry kept the town awake till
morning.&nbsp; From the open windows the night was filled with
dancing tunes, and songs, and laughter; boys cried &ldquo;Fab,
fab!&rdquo; in the street, and a fairy lady&mdash;really a lady
all grown up, alas!&mdash;stood at a window and showered pence
among them.</p>
<p>Long before the wedding-party ended, Bud went up to bed, but
she lay for hours awake in the camceil room hearing the revelry
of the kitchen.&nbsp; She had said good-bye to the blissful pair
whose wedding was the consequence of her own daft pranks as
letter-writer: she would miss the maid of Colonsay.&nbsp; The
knowledge that &rsquo;tis an uncertain world, a place of change
and partings, comes to us all sooner or later in one flash of
apprehension and of grief: for the first time Bud felt the
irrevocable nature of the past, and that her happy world under
this roof was, someway, crumbling, and the tears came to her
eyes.</p>
<p>A hurried footstep sounded on the stairs, a rap came to her
door, and the bride came in, unbid, in the darkness, whispering
Lennox&rsquo;s name.</p>
<p>Her only answer was a sob from the girl in bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Lennox!&rdquo; said the bride distressed;
&ldquo;what ails you?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve come up to say good-bye:
it wasn&rsquo;t a right good-bye at all with yon folk
looking.&nbsp; Oh, Lennox, Lennox! <i>ghaol mo chridhe</i>! my
heart is sore <a name="page264"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
264</span>to be leaving you, for the two of us were so
merry!&nbsp; Now I have a man, and a good man too; it was you
that gave me him, but I have lost my loving friend.&rdquo;&nbsp;
She threw herself on the bed, regardless of her finery, and the
Celtic fount of her swelled over in sobs and tears.</p>
<h2><a name="page265"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
265</span>CHAPTER XXXII.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> took two maids to fill
Kate&rsquo;s place in the Dyces&rsquo; household&mdash;one for
the plain boiling of potatoes and the other for her pious
atmosphere, as the lawyer argued; and a period of discomfort
attended on what Bell called their breaking-in.&nbsp; No more
kitchen nights for Lennox, now that she was a finished young lady
and her friend was gone: she must sit in the parlour strumming
canzonets on Grandma Buntain&rsquo;s Broadwood, taming her heart
of fire.&nbsp; It was as a voice from heaven&rsquo;s lift there
came one day a letter from London in which Mrs Molyneux invited
her and one of her aunts for an Easter holiday.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed and I&rsquo;ll be glad to be quit for a week or
two of both of you,&rdquo; said Bell to her niece and
Ailie.&nbsp; &ldquo;Spring-cleaning, with a couple of stupid
huzzies in the kitchen,&mdash;not but what they&rsquo;re nice and
willing lassies,&mdash;is like to be the sooner ended if
we&rsquo;re left to it ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A radiant visage and lips in firm control betrayed how Lennox
felt.&nbsp; She had never been in London&mdash;its cry went
pealing through her heart.&nbsp; Ailie said nothing, but
marvelled how blithely and blindly her sister always set foot on
the facile descent that led to her inevitable doom of deprivation
and regret.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Grand Tour!&rdquo; said Uncle Dan;
&ldquo;it&rsquo;s the fitting termination to your daft days,
Lennox.&nbsp; Up by at the Castle there&rsquo;s a chariot with
imperials that conveyed the Earl on his, the hammercloth most
lamentably faded: I often wonder if his lordship takes a sly seat
in it at times when no one&rsquo;s looking, <a
name="page266"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 266</span>and climbs
the Alps or clatters through Italian towns again when Jones the
coachman is away at his tea.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a thing I might do
myself if I had made the Tour and still had the
shandrydan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you really need me?&rdquo; Aunt Ailie asked
her sister, and half hoped, half feared spring-cleaning should
postpone the holiday; but Bell maintained it should be now or
never, more particularly as Lennox&rsquo;s dress was new.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Oh, London, London! siren town! how it bewitched the
girl!&nbsp; Its cab-horse bells were fairy; its evening, as they
entered, hung with a myriad magic moons and stars.&nbsp; The
far-stretching streets with their flaming jewel windows, the
temples in the upper dusk, and the solemn squares crowding round
country trees; the throngs of people, the odours of fruit-shops,
the passion of flowers, the mornings silvery grey, and the
multitudinous monuments rimed by years, thunder of hoofs in ways
without end, and the silence of mighty parks,&mdash;Bud lay awake
in the nights to think of them.</p>
<p>Jim Molyneux had the siren by the throat: he loved her, and
shook a living out of her hands.&nbsp; At first she had seemed to
him too old, too calm, too slow and stately as compared with his
own Chicago, nor did she seem to have a place for any stranger:
now he had found she could be bullied,&mdash;that a loud voice, a
bold front, and the aid of a good tailor could compel her to
disgorge respect and gold.&nbsp; He had become the manager of a
suburban theatre, where oranges were eaten in the stalls, and the
play was as often as not &ldquo;The Father&rsquo;s Curse&rdquo;;
but once a day he walked past Thespian temples in the city, and,
groaning at their mismanagement, planned an early future for
himself with classic fronts of marble, and duchesses advertising
him each night by standing in rows on the pavement awaiting their
carriages.&nbsp; Far along Grove Lane, where he dwelt in a
pea-green house with nine French-bean rows and some clumps of
bulbs behind, one could distinguish his coming by <a
name="page267"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 267</span>the
smartness of his walk and the gleam of the sunshine on his
hat.&nbsp; He had one more secret of
success&mdash;teetotalism.&nbsp; &ldquo;Scotch and soda,&rdquo;
he would say, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s what ails the boys, and makes
&rsquo;em sleepier than Hank M&rsquo;Cabe&rsquo;s old
tom-cat.&nbsp; Good boys, dear boys, they&rsquo;ve always got the
long-lost-brother grip, but they&rsquo;re mighty prone to dope
assuagements for the all-gone feeling in the middle of the
day.&nbsp; When they&rsquo;ve got cobwebs in their little
brilliantined belfries, I&rsquo;m full of the songs of spring and
merry old England&rsquo;s on the lee.&nbsp; See? I don&rsquo;t
even need to grab; all I&rsquo;ve got to do is to look deserving,
and the stuff comes crowding in: it always does to a man who
looks like ready-money, and don&rsquo;t lunch on cocktails and
cloves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jim, boyette,&rdquo; his wife would say, &ldquo;I guess
you&rsquo;d better put ice or something on your bump of
self-esteem;&rdquo; but she proudly wore the jewels that were the
rewards of his confidence and industry.</p>
<p>Bud and Ailie, when they thought of home in these days,
thought of it as a picture only, or as a chapter in a book
covered in mouldy leather, with <i>f</i>&rsquo;s for
<i>s</i>&rsquo;s.&nbsp; In their prayers alone were Dan and Bell
real personages; and the far-off little town was no longer a
woodcut, but an actual place blown through by the scented airs of
forest and sea.&nbsp; Bell wrote them of rains and hails and
misty weather; Grove Lane gardens breathed of daffodils, and the
city gleamed under a constant sun.&nbsp; They came back to the
pea-green house each day from rare adventuring, looking, in the
words of Molyneux, as if they were fresh come off the farm, and
the best seats in half a dozen theatres were at their
disposal.&nbsp; &ldquo;Too much of the playhouse
altogether!&rdquo; Bell wrote once, remonstrating.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Have you heard that man in the City Temple yet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>In Molyneux&rsquo;s own theatre there was a break in the long
succession of melodrama and musical comedy.&nbsp; He privately
rejoiced that, for two ladies of such taste as Ailie and her
niece, he could display a piece of the <a
name="page268"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 268</span>real
legitimate&mdash;&ldquo;King John,&rdquo;&mdash;though Camberwell
was not very likely to make a week of Shakespeare very profitable
to his treasury.&nbsp; Ailie and Bud were to go on Tuesday; and
Bud sat up at night to read an acting copy of &ldquo;King
John&rdquo; till every character took flesh in her imagination,
and the little iron balcony behind the pea-green house became the
battlemented walls of Angiers, to whose postern came trumpeters
of France.</p>
<p>They sat in the drawing-room, astonished at her
speeches&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;You men of Angiers, open wide your
gates,<br />
And let young Arthur, Duke of Bretagne, in,<br />
Who by the hand of France this day hath made<br />
Much work for tears in many an English mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Or&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;I am not mad: this hair I tear is
mine;<br />
My name is Constance; I was Geffrey&rsquo;s wife;<br />
Young Arthur is my son, and he is lost!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bravo, Bud!&rdquo; would Molyneux cry, delighted.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Why, if I was an actor-manager, I&rsquo;d pay you any
salary you had the front to name.&nbsp; Ain&rsquo;t she just
great, Millicent?&nbsp; I tell you, Miss Ailie, she puts the
blinkers on Maude Adams, and sends Ellen &rsquo;way back in the
standing-room only.&nbsp; Girly, all you&rsquo;ve got to learn is
how to move.&nbsp; You mustn&rsquo;t stand two minutes in the
same place on the stage, but cross &rsquo;most every
cue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Bud dubiously.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Why should folk have fidgets on a stage?&nbsp; They
don&rsquo;t always have them in real life.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d want
to stand like a mountain&mdash;<i>you</i> know, Auntie Ailie, the
old hills at home!&mdash;and look so&mdash;so&mdash;so awful, the
audience would shriek if I moved, the same as if I was going to
fall on them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that how you feel?&rdquo; asked Jim Molyneux,
curiously surveying her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; that&rsquo;s how I feel,&rdquo; said Bud,
&ldquo;when I&rsquo;ve got <a name="page269"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 269</span>the zip of poetry in me.&nbsp; I
feel I&rsquo;m all made up of burning words and eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Child, you are very young!&rdquo; said Mrs
Molyneux.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Bud; &ldquo;I suppose that&rsquo;s
it.&nbsp; By-and-by I&rsquo;ll maybe get to be like other
people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim Molyneux struck the table with his open hand.&nbsp;
&ldquo;By George!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t hurry
being like other people; that&rsquo;s what every gol-darned idiot
in England&rsquo;s trying, and you&rsquo;re right on the spot
just now as you stand.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s straight talk, nothing
but!&nbsp; I allow I favour a bit of leg movement on the
stage&mdash;generally it&rsquo;s about the only life there is on
it; but a woman who can play with her head don&rsquo;t need to
wear out much shoe-leather.&nbsp; Girly&mdash;&rdquo; he stopped
a second, then burst out with the question: &ldquo;How&rsquo;d
you like a little part in this &lsquo;King
John&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A flame went over the countenance of the girl, and then she
grew exceedingly pale.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she
exclaimed&mdash;&ldquo;Oh! Jim Molyneux, don&rsquo;t be so
cruel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean it,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and I could fix it,
for they&rsquo;ve got an Arthur in the caste who&rsquo;s ill and
bound to break down in a day or two if she had an
understudy&mdash;and if I&mdash;&nbsp; Think you could play a
boy&rsquo;s part?&nbsp; There isn&rsquo;t much to learn in
Arthur, but that little speech of yours in front of Angiers makes
me think you could make the part loom out enough to catch the eye
of the cognoscenti.&nbsp; You&rsquo;d let her, wouldn&rsquo;t
you, Miss Ailie?&nbsp; It&rsquo;d be great fun.&nbsp; She&rsquo;d
learn the lines in an hour or two, and a couple of nights of
looking on would put her up to all the business.&nbsp; Now
don&rsquo;t kick, Miss Ailie; say, Miss Ailie, have this little
treat with us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ailie&rsquo;s heart was leaping.&nbsp; Here was the
crisis,&mdash;she knew it,&mdash;what was she to do?&nbsp; She
had long anticipated some such hour&mdash;had often wrestled with
the problem whether, when it came, the world should have her Bud
without a struggle for the claims of Bell and the simple
cloistered life of the Scottish home.&nbsp; While yet the crisis
was in prospect only, she could come to no conclusion.&nbsp; Her
own wild hungers as a <a name="page270"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 270</span>girl, recalled one night in the
light of kitchen candles, had never ceased to plead for
freedom,&mdash;for freedom and the space that herself had years
ago surrendered: now it was the voice of the little elder sister,
and the bell of Wanton Wully ringing at evening humble people
home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just this once!&rdquo; pleaded Mr Molyneux,
understanding her scruples: Bud&rsquo;s face mutely pleaded.</p>
<p>Yes, &ldquo;just this once!&rdquo;&mdash;it was all very well,
but Ailie knew the dangers of beginnings.&nbsp; It would not even
be, in this case, a beginning; the beginning was years
ago&mdash;before the mimicry on the first New Year&rsquo;s
morning, before the night of the dozen candles, or the creation
of The Macintosh: the child had been carried onward like a
feather in a stream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I really don&rsquo;t mind much, myself,&rdquo; said
Ailie at last; &ldquo;but I fancy her Aunt Bell would scarcely
like it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not if she knew I was going to do it,&rdquo; said
Lennox quickly; &ldquo;but when the thing was over she&rsquo;d be
as pleased as Punch&mdash;at least, she&rsquo;d laugh the way she
did when we told her I was dressed as Grandma Buntain at the
ball.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sound of Will Oliver&rsquo;s curfew died low in
Ailie&rsquo;s mind, the countenance of Bell grew dim: she heard,
instead, the clear young voice of Bud among the scenery and sat
with an enraptured audience.&nbsp; &ldquo;If you are all so
anxious for it, then&mdash;&rdquo; she said, and the deed was
done!</p>
<p>She did not rue it when the night of Bud&rsquo;s performance
came, and her niece as the hapless young Bretagne welcomed the
Dauphin before the city gates: she gloried in the natural
poignancy that marked the painful scene with Hubert come to
torture, but she almost rued it when Molyneux, having escorted
them in an inexplicable silence home, broke out at last in
fervent praise of his discovery as soon as the girl had left them
for her bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve kept clutch of myself with considerable
difficulty,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;for I didn&rsquo;t want to
spoil girly&rsquo;s sleep <a name="page271"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 271</span>or swell her head, but I want to
tell you, Millicent, and you, Miss Ailie, that <span
class="smcap">I&rsquo;ve Found my Star</span>!&nbsp; Why, say!
she&rsquo;s out of sight!&nbsp; She was the only actor in all
that company to-night who didn&rsquo;t know she was in
Camberwell: she was right in the middle of medieval France from
start to finish, and when she was picked up dead at the end of
the fourth act she was so stone-cold and stiff with thinking it
she scared the company.&nbsp; I suspect, Miss Ailie, that
you&rsquo;re going to lose that girl!&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page272"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
272</span>CHAPTER XXXIII.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was a wet night in
November.&nbsp; With a chuckle of horse&rsquo;s hoofs on shining
streets, Dan Dyce, with Bell and Ailie, drove from
Molyneux&rsquo;s fine new home to the temple of his former
dreams&mdash;the proud Imperial.&nbsp; They sat in silence in the
darkness of the cab, and in silence drifted into the
entrance-hall of the theatre to mingle with the pompous world
incongruously&mdash;with loud vain-glorious men, who bore to the
eye of Bell some spirit of abandonment and mockery, with women
lovely by the gift of God, or with dead-white faces, wax-red
lips, and stealthy sidelong eyes.&nbsp; One there was who,
passing before them, released a great fur cloak from her
shoulders with a sudden movement, and, as it slowly slipped down
her marble back, threatened an utter nakedness that made Bell
gasp and clutch at her sister&rsquo;s arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; said Ailie eagerly&mdash;before them was a
portrait of a woman in the dress of Desdemona.&nbsp; The face had
some suggestion that at times it might be childlike and serene,
but had been caught in a moment of alarm and fire, and the full
black eyes held in their orbs some frightful apprehension, the
slightly parted lips expressed a soul&rsquo;s mute cry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&nbsp; Who is it?&rdquo; asked Bell, pausing
before the picture with a stound of fear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is Bud,&rdquo; said Ailie, feeling proud and
sorrowful&mdash;for why she could not tell.&nbsp; &ldquo;There is
the name: &lsquo;Winifred Wallace.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bell wrung her hands in the shelter of her mantle <a
name="page273"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 273</span>and stood
bewildered, searching for the well-known lineaments.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us go up,&rdquo; said Dan softly, with no heed for
the jostling people, for ever self-possessed, sorrowful to guess
at his sister&rsquo;s mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, let us go up out of this crowd,&rdquo; said
Ailie, but the little woman hung before the portrait
fascinated.&nbsp; Round her washed the waves of rustling garments
like a surf on the shore at home; scents wafted; English voices,
almost foreign in their accent, fell upon her ear all unnoticed
since she faced the sudden revelation of what her brother&rsquo;s
child, her darling, had become.&nbsp; Seekers of pleasure,
killers of wholesome cares, froth of the idle world eddied around
her chattering, laughing, glancing curious or contemptuous at her
grey sweet face, her homely form, her simple Sabbath garments:
all her heart cried out in supplication for the child that had
too soon become a woman and wandered from the sanctuary of
home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are blocking the way here, Bell.&nbsp; Let us go
up,&rdquo; again said Ailie, gently taking her arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said her brother.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
not a time for contemplation of the tombs&mdash;it&rsquo;s not
the kirkyard, Bell.&nbsp; You see there are many that are anxious
to get in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Lennox, Lennox!&rdquo; she exclaimed, indifferent
to the strangers round about her, &ldquo;my brother&rsquo;s
child!&nbsp; I wish&mdash;oh, I wish ye were at home!&nbsp; God
grant ye grace and wisdom: &lsquo;Then shalt thou walk in thy way
safely, and thy foot shall not stumble.&nbsp; When thou liest
down, thou shalt not be afraid: yea, thou shalt lie down, and thy
sleep shall be sweet.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>They went up to the box that Molyneux had kept for them, to
find his wife there nursing an enormous bouquet of flowers, all
white as the driven snow.&nbsp; &ldquo;A gorgeous house!&rdquo;
she told them.&nbsp; &ldquo;Everybody that&rsquo;s anybody, and
in the front push.&nbsp; Half a hundred critics, two real Count
Vons, a lot of benzine brougham people who never miss a first
night&mdash;there are their wives, poor dears! shining same as
they were Tiffany&rsquo;s <a name="page274"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 274</span>windows.&nbsp; My! ain&rsquo;t our
Bud going to have a happy night!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They sat and looked for a while in silence at the scene before
them, so pleasing to the mind that sought, in crowds, in light
and warmth and gaiety, its happiest associations; so wanting in
the great eternal calm and harmony that are out of doors in
country places.&nbsp; Serpent eyes in facets of gems on
women&rsquo;s bosoms; heads made monstrous yet someway beautiful
and tempting by the barber&rsquo;s art; shoulders bare and
bleached, devoid of lustre; others blushing as if Eve&rsquo;s
sudden apprehension had survived the generations.&nbsp; Sleek
shaven faces, linen breastplates, opera-glasses, flowers, fans, a
murmur of voices, and the flame over all of the enormous
electrolier.</p>
<p>It was the first time Bell had seen a theatre.&nbsp; Her first
thought was one of blame and pity.&nbsp; &ldquo;&lsquo;He looked
on the city and wept&rsquo;!&rdquo; said she.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh,
Ailie, that it were over and we were home!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All to see Miss Winifred Wallace!&rdquo; said Mrs
Molyneux.&nbsp; &ldquo;Think of that, Miss Dyce,&mdash;your
darling niece, and she&rsquo;ll be so proud and happy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bell sighed.&nbsp; &ldquo;At least she had got her own way,
and I am a foolish old country-woman who had different
plans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dan said nothing.&nbsp; Ailie waited too, silent, in a
feverish expectation; and from the fiddles rose a sudden
melody.&nbsp; It seemed the only wise and sober thing in all that
humming hive of gaudy insects passing, passing, passing.&nbsp; It
gave a voice to human longings for a nobler, better world; and in
it, too, were memory and tears.&nbsp; To the people in the box it
seemed to tell Bud&rsquo;s story&mdash;opening in calm sweet
passages, closing in the roll of trumpet and the throb of
drum.&nbsp; And then the lights went down, and the curtain rose
upon the street in Venice.</p>
<p>The early scenes were dumb and vacant, wanting Bud&rsquo;s
presence: there was no play for them till she <a
name="page275"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 275</span>came slowly
into the council chamber where sat the senators, timidity and
courage struggling in her port and visage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no; it is not Bud,&rdquo; Bell whispered.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It is not our lassie, this one is too tall and&mdash;and
too deliberate.&nbsp; I fear she has not dared it at the last, or
that she has been found unsuitable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ailie leaned forward, quivering, feeding her eyes.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no one else,&rdquo; said she.&nbsp; &ldquo;Dear
Bud, <i>our</i> Bud!&nbsp; Those two years&rsquo; training may
have made her someways different, but she has not changed her
smile.&nbsp; Oh! I am so proud, and sure of her!&nbsp;
Hus-s-sh!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;I do perceive here a divided duty:<br />
To you I am bound for life and education;<br />
My life and education both do learn me<br />
How to respect you; you are the lord of duty:<br />
I am hitherto your daughter: but here&rsquo;s my
husband.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Desdemona&rsquo;s first speech broke the stillness that had
fallen on the house: her face was pale, they saw the rapid
heaving of her bosom, they heard a moment&rsquo;s tremor in her
voice matured and wonderful, sweet as a silver bell.&nbsp; To the
box where she knew her friends were sitting she let her eyes for
a second wander as she spoke the opening lines that had so much
of double meaning&mdash;not Desdemona, but the loving and wilful
child asking forgiveness, yet tenacious of her purpose.</p>
<p>To Ailie came relief and happiness and pride: Dan held a
watching brief for his elder sister&rsquo;s prejudices and his
own philosophy.&nbsp; Bell sat in tears which Shakespeare did not
influence.&nbsp; When next she saw the stage with unblurred eyes
Desdemona was leaving with the Moor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dears,&rdquo; said Mrs Molyneux, &ldquo;as Desdemona
she&rsquo;s the Only One! and Jim was right.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
worth a thousand times more trouble than he took with her.&nbsp;
He said all along she&rsquo;d dazzle them, and I guess her <a
name="page276"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
276</span>fortune&rsquo;s made, and it&rsquo;s going to be the
making of this house too.&nbsp; I feel so proud and happy
I&rsquo;d kiss you right here, Mr Dyce, if it wouldn&rsquo;t mess
up my bouquet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A black man!&rdquo; said Bell regretfully.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I know it is only paint, of course, but&mdash;but I never
met him; I do not even know his name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It seemed as if the play had nothing in it but the words and
acts of Desdemona.&nbsp; At each appearance she became more
confident, charged the part with deeper feeling, found new
meaning in the time-worn words.&nbsp; Even Bell began to lose her
private judgment, forget that it was nothing but a sinful play,
and feel some pity for Othello; but, as the knavish coils closed
round her Desdemona, the strain became unbearable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! I cannot stand it any longer,&rdquo; she exclaimed,
when the voice of Lennox quavered in the song before her last
good-night, and saying so, pushed back her seat into the shadows
of the box, covering her ears with her fingers.&nbsp; She saw no
more; she heard no more till the audience rose to its feet with
thunders of applause that swelled and sunk and swelled again as
if it would never end.&nbsp; Then she dared to look, and saw a
trembling Desdemona all alone before a curtain bowing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the matter?&nbsp; What is the matter?&nbsp; Why
are they crying that way on her?&rdquo; she asked,
dumbfounded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, don&rsquo;t you see they&rsquo;re mad!&rdquo; said
Mrs Molyneux.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear! and I thought she was doing
splendidly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glad mad, I mean.&nbsp; She has carried them off their
feet, and I&rsquo;ll bet Jim Molyneux is standing on his hands
behind that drop and waving his legs in the air.&nbsp; Guess I
needn&rsquo;t waste this bouquet on a girl who looks like the
morning hour in Covent Garden.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page277"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
277</span>Molyneux burst into the box in a gust of wild
excitement.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come round, come round at once&mdash;she
wants to see you,&rdquo; he exclaimed, and led them deviously
behind the scenes to her dressing-room.</p>
<p>She stood at the door, softly crying; she looked at
them&mdash;the grave old uncle; Ailie who could understand, the
little Auntie Bell,&mdash;it was into the arms of Bell she threw
herself!</p>

278</span>CHAPTER XXXIV.</h2>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">The</span> talk of the whole of
London!&nbsp; The beauteous Lady Anne herself&rsquo;s not in it
with her!&rdquo; said Will Oliver, scratching behind his
ears.&nbsp; &ldquo;Man, is it no&rsquo; just desperate?&nbsp; But
I&rsquo;ll warrant ye there&rsquo;s money in it, for it&rsquo;s
yonder folk are willing to pay well for their
diversion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure,&rdquo; said P. &amp; A.,
&ldquo;it&rsquo;s not another woman altogether?&nbsp; It gives
the name of Wallace in the paper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bellman, sitting on a soap-box, slapped his thigh and
said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m telling ye; I had it long ago from Kate
MacNeill that her name on the stage was going to be
Wallace&mdash;Winifred Wallace, and there it is in print.&nbsp;
Tra&mdash;tragedienny, tragediennys are the head ones in the
trade: I&rsquo;ve seen them in the shows&mdash;tr-r-r-emendous
women!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Provost, who had just stepped into P. &amp; A.&rsquo;s for
his Sunday sweeties, smiled tolerantly and passed his
taddy-box.&nbsp; &ldquo;Bud Dyce,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;is never
likely to be round this way in a caravan to do the deid-drap
three times every night for front-seats sixpence.&nbsp; I doubt
we have seen the last of her, unless we have the money and the
clothes for London theatres.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s really her, then?&rdquo; said the
grocer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can take Wull&rsquo;s word for that,&rdquo; said
the Provost, &ldquo;and I have just been talking to her
uncle.&nbsp; Her history&rsquo;s in the morning paper, and
I&rsquo;m the civic head of a town renowned for
genius.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wanton Wully went out to drift along the street <a
name="page279"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 279</span>in the
light of the bright shop-windows before which bairns played
&ldquo;chaps me,&rdquo; making choice of treasures for their
gaudiness alone, like most of us, who should know better.&nbsp;
He met George Jordon.&nbsp; &ldquo;Geordie,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;you&rsquo;ll have heard the latest?&nbsp; You should be in
London: yon&rsquo;s the place for oddity,&rdquo; and George, with
misty comprehension, turned about for the road to London
town.&nbsp; Out of the inn came Colin Cleland, hurried, in his
hand the business-looking packet of tattered documents that were
always his excuse for being there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Winifred Wallace&mdash;Great Tragedienny!&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s a droll thing life, according to the way you look at
it.&nbsp; Stirring times in London, Mr Cleland!&nbsp; Changed her
name to Wallace, having come of decent worthy people.&nbsp; We
know, but we&rsquo;ll not let on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a word!&rdquo; said Colin Cleland comically.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Perhaps she may get better and the thing blow by.&nbsp;
Are you under the impression that celebrity&rsquo;s a thing to be
ashamed of?&nbsp; I tell you she&rsquo;s a credit to us
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord bless me! do you say so?&rdquo; asked Wull
Oliver.&nbsp; &ldquo;If I was a tragedienny I would be ashamed to
show my face in the place again.&nbsp; We all expected something
better from the wee one&mdash;she was such a caution!&nbsp; It
was myself, as you might say, invented her: I gave her a start at
devilment by letting her ring the New Year bell.&nbsp; After that
she always called me Mr Wanton, and kindly inquired at me about
my legs.&nbsp; She was always quite the leddy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Minto&rsquo;s shop was busy: a boy was in with a very red
face demanding the remnants that by rights should have gone home
with his mother&rsquo;s jacket, and the Misses Duff were buying
chiffon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is startling news about young Lennox Dyce,&rdquo;
remarked Miss Minto.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s caused what you
might call a stir.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s not a weekly paper to be
had for love or money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was always most peculiar,&rdquo; said Miss
Jean.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bizarre,&rdquo; cooed Miss Amelia,&mdash;it was her
latest adjective.</p>
<p><a name="page280"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
280</span>&ldquo;I was sure there was something special about in
her since the very first day I saw her,&rdquo; said the
mantua-maker.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yon eye, Miss Duff!&nbsp; And what a
sweet and confident expression!&nbsp; I am so glad she has
pleased them up in London; you never can depend on them.&nbsp; I
am thinking of a novel blouse to mark in what I think will be a
pleasing way the great occasion&mdash;the Winifred Wallace Waist
I&rsquo;m calling it: you remember the clever Mr
Molyneux?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I doubt we never understood her,&rdquo; said Miss
Jean.&nbsp; &ldquo;But we make a feature now of
elocution,&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not that we wish to turn out great tragediennes,&rdquo;
said Miss Amelia.&nbsp; &ldquo;There&rsquo;s happiness in humbler
vocations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I daresay there is,&rdquo; confessed Miss Minto.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I never thought of the stage myself; my gift was always
dressmaking, and you wouldn&rsquo;t believe the satisfaction
that&rsquo;s in seeing a dress of mine on a woman who can do it
justice.&nbsp; We have all our own bit art, and that&rsquo;s a
wonderful consolation.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;m very glad at that
girl&rsquo;s progress, for the sake of Mr Dyce&mdash;and, of
course, his sisters.&nbsp; Miss Ailie is transported, in the
seventh heaven, and even her sister seems quite pleased.&nbsp;
&lsquo;You&rsquo;ll have a high head to-day,&rsquo; I said to her
when she was passing from the coach this afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what did she say to that?&rdquo; inquired Miss
Jean, with curiosity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know Miss Dyce!&nbsp; She gave a smile and said,
&lsquo;But a humble heart&mdash;it&rsquo;s the Dyces&rsquo;
motto.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The doctor put his paper down, having read the great news over
several times with a singular satisfaction that surprised his
sisters, who were beat to see much glory in a state of life that
meant your name on every wall and the picture of your
drawing-room every other week in &lsquo;Homely
Notes.&rsquo;&nbsp; Drawing on his boots, he took a turn the
length of the lawyer&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Faith!&nbsp; London has the luck of it,&rdquo; he said
on entering.&nbsp; &ldquo;I wish I was there myself to see this
<a name="page281"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
281</span>wonderful Desdemona.&nbsp; I hope you liked your jaunt,
Miss Bell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t bad,&rdquo; said Bell, putting out the
cards.&nbsp; &ldquo;But, mercy on me! what a silly way they have
of baking bread in England&mdash;all crust outside, though I
grant it&rsquo;s sweet enough when you break into it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m!&rdquo; said Dr Brash, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen
Scotch folk a bit like that.&nbsp; She has rung the bell, I see;
her name is made.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is, they tell me,&rdquo; answered Bell, &ldquo;but I
hope it will never change her nature.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She had aye a genius,&rdquo; said Mr Dyce, cutting the
pack for partners.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She had something better,&rdquo; said Miss Ailie,
&ldquo;she had love;&rdquo; and on the town broke forth the
evening bell.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
